# Testing Strategy

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy for the ADAM v21.0 platform. The goal of the testing strategy is to ensure that the system is reliable, performs as expected, and meets the quality standards of the business.

## 2. Levels of Testing

The testing strategy will include the following levels of testing:

*   **Unit Testing:** Each individual component will be tested in isolation to ensure that it functions correctly. Unit tests will be written by the developers and will be run automatically as part of the continuous integration (CI) process.
*   **Integration Testing:** The interactions between different components will be tested to ensure that they work together as expected. Integration tests will be run after the unit tests have passed.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** The entire system will be tested from end to end to ensure that it meets the business requirements. E2E tests will simulate real-world user scenarios and will be run in a production-like environment.
*   **Performance Testing:** The system will be tested for performance and scalability to ensure that it can handle the expected load. Performance tests will measure key metrics such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization.
*   **Security Testing:** The system will be tested for security vulnerabilities to ensure that it is secure from unauthorized access and use. Security testing will include penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.

## 3. Test Automation

All tests will be automated as much as possible. This will allow for faster and more reliable testing, and will free up the developers to focus on building new features.

The test automation framework will be integrated with the CI/CD pipeline, so that tests are run automatically whenever new code is committed.

## 4. Test Environments

The following test environments will be used:

*   **Development Environment:** Each developer will have their own local development environment for writing and testing code.
*   **CI/CD Environment:** A dedicated environment for running automated tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Staging Environment:** A production-like environment for running E2E tests and performance tests.
*   **Production Environment:** The live environment where the system is used by end-users.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Developers:** Responsible for writing and running unit tests.
*   **QA Engineers:** Responsible for writing and running integration tests, E2E tests, and performance tests.
*   **Security Engineers:** Responsible for conducting security testing.
*   **DevOps Engineers:** Responsible for setting up and maintaining the test environments.
