# Project Vision and Business Requirements

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the vision, goals, and business requirements for the Production Integration of the Data Store Prompt Library Ingestion SharePoint Labeling Warehouse Repository (the "Project"). The Project aims to create a comprehensive, self-contained, and portable system that integrates a variety of data sources and provides a central webpage for API integration and a user-facing chatbot.

The system will leverage the existing ADAM v21.0 platform, extending its capabilities to meet the specific needs of the business. The project will also include the development of a detailed technical specification guide to ensure that the system is well-documented and can be easily maintained and extended in the future.

## 2. Vision

To create a world-class, AI-powered financial analysis platform that provides a seamless and intuitive user experience. The platform will empower financial analysts and decision-makers with the tools they need to make informed decisions, manage risk, and identify new opportunities.

The system will be designed to be highly modular, portable, and extensible, allowing it to be easily adapted to new use cases and integrated with other systems. It will also be designed to be highly transparent, with clear and auditable processes for data ingestion, analysis, and decision-making.

## 3. Goals

The primary goals of this project are to:

*   **Integrate Key Data Sources:** Integrate the data store, prompt library, SharePoint, and data warehouse into a single, unified system.
*   **Provide a Central API:** Develop a central API that allows for easy integration with other systems and services.
*   **Deliver an Intuitive User Experience:** Create a user-friendly web interface and chatbot that makes it easy for users to access the system's capabilities.
*   **Support Multiple Modes of Operation:** Support both prompted (human-in-the-loop) and fully autonomous modes of operation.
*   **Track Resource Usage:** Implement a system for tracking and managing compute and token usage.
*   **Ensure Modularity and Portability:** Design the system to be self-contained, modular, and easily portable to different environments.
*   **Create Comprehensive Documentation:** Develop a detailed technical specification guide that documents all aspects of the system.

## 4. Business Requirements

### 4.1. Data Integration

*   The system must be able to ingest data from a variety of sources, including a data store, a prompt library, SharePoint, and a data warehouse.
*   The system must provide a mechanism for labeling and organizing ingested data.
*   The system must be able to store and manage large volumes of data in a secure and efficient manner.

### 4.2. API and User Interface

*   The system must provide a central RESTful API for programmatic access to its features.
*   The system must provide a web-based user interface that allows users to interact with the system.
*   The user interface must include a chatbot that can answer user questions and perform tasks.

### 4.3. Agentic Processes

*   The system must support both prompted (human-in-the-loop) and fully autonomous modes of operation.
*   In prompted mode, the system must allow users to guide the agent's decision-making process.
*   In autonomous mode, the agent must be able to perform tasks without human intervention.
*   The system must provide a clear and auditable trail of the agent's actions and decisions.

### 4.4. Resource Management

*   The system must track and report on the usage of compute resources and LLM tokens.
*   The system must provide mechanisms for managing and optimizing resource usage.

### 4.5. Modularity and Portability

*   The system must be designed in a modular fashion, with clear separation of concerns between components.
*   The system must be self-contained and easily portable to different environments (e.g., on-premises, cloud).

## 5. User Stories

### 5.1. Data Integration

*   **As a** data engineer, **I want** to be able to easily configure the system to ingest data from a new SharePoint site, **so that** I can quickly make new documents available to the analysts.
*   **As a** financial analyst, **I want** the system to automatically extract key information from ingested documents, **so that** I can spend less time on manual data entry and more time on analysis.
*   **As a** system administrator, **I want** to be able to monitor the data ingestion process and receive alerts if there are any failures, **so that** I can ensure the data is always up-to-date.

### 5.2. API and User Interface

*   **As a** developer, **I want** to be able to use the central API to integrate the ADAM platform with other internal systems, **so that** I can leverage its analytical capabilities in other applications.
*   **As a** financial analyst, **I want** to be able to use the web interface to easily search for and retrieve information from the knowledge base, **so that** I can quickly find the data I need for my analysis.
*   **As a** portfolio manager, **I want** to be able to use the chatbot to get a quick overview of my portfolio's performance, **so that** I can stay informed without having to navigate through multiple screens.

### 5.3. Agentic Processes

*   **As a** junior analyst, **I want** to be able to use the prompted mode to get guidance from the system when performing a complex analysis, **so that** I can learn from the system and improve my skills.
*   **As a** senior analyst, **I want** to be able to run the system in autonomous mode to quickly generate a standard report, **so that** I can save time on routine tasks.
*   **As a** compliance officer, **I want** to be able to review the audit trail of an agent's decisions, **so that** I can ensure that the system is operating in a compliant manner.

### 5.4. Resource Management

*   **As a** department head, **I want** to be able to see a report of the token usage for my team, **so that** I can manage my budget effectively.
*   **As a** system administrator, **I want** to be able to set quotas on token usage for different users and groups, **so that** I can prevent abuse and control costs.

## 6. Scope

### 6.1. In Scope

*   The creation of a technical specification guide that covers all the requirements listed in this document.
*   The development of a central API and a web-based user interface with a chatbot.
*   The integration of the data store, prompt library, SharePoint, and data warehouse.
*   The implementation of the agentic processes, including both prompted and autonomous modes.
*   The implementation of the resource management system.

### 6.2. Out of Scope

*   The development of new AI models or algorithms. The system will leverage existing models and algorithms from the ADAM v21.0 platform.
*   The migration of existing data into the new system. The project will focus on the integration of new data sources.
*   The development of a mobile application. The user interface will be web-based only.
