# Security Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the security measures for the ADAM v21.0 platform. Security is a critical aspect of the system, and this document describes the policies and procedures that will be implemented to protect the system and its data from unauthorized access and use.

## 2. Authentication

All access to the system will be authenticated. The central API will use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. Users will be required to provide a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header of each API request.

The JWT will be issued by a trusted identity provider (IdP) and will contain information about the user, such as their user ID and roles.

## 3. Authorization

Authorization will be based on the user's roles, which will be included in the JWT. The system will use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to resources and operations.

For example, a user with the `analyst` role might be able to view data and run analyses, while a user with the `admin` role would be able to manage users and configure the system.

## 4. Data Encryption

All data will be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

*   **Encryption in Transit:** All communication between the client and the server will be encrypted using TLS 1.3.
*   **Encryption at Rest:** All data stored in the data warehouse, data store, and knowledge base will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).

## 5. Vulnerability Management

The system will be regularly scanned for vulnerabilities using a combination of static and dynamic analysis tools. Any identified vulnerabilities will be prioritized and remediated in a timely manner.

Penetration testing will also be conducted on a regular basis to identify and address any potential security weaknesses.

## 6. Secure Coding Practices

All code will be written in accordance with secure coding best practices. This includes:

*   **Input Validation:** All user input will be validated to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Error Handling:** The system will handle errors gracefully and will not expose sensitive information in error messages.
*   **Dependency Management:** All third-party dependencies will be regularly scanned for vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Reviews:** All code will be reviewed for security vulnerabilities before it is deployed to production.
