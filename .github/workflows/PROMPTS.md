Of course! To get the best results from an AI assistant like ADAM for your repository, it's all about providing clear, specific, and context-rich prompts.
The key is to treat the AI as a specialized assistant and give it a role, context, and a clear goal. Here are top-tier prompt suggestions categorized by task. ðŸš€
## For Code Refactoring & Improvement
These prompts help you clean up, optimize, and document your code at a micro level.
 * General Refactoring:
   > "Act as a senior software engineer specializing in <language, e.g., Python>. Refactor the following code to improve its readability, performance, and adherence to best practices like <DRY, SOLID>. Do not change its functionality. Provide the refactored code and a brief bullet-point list of the key changes you made."
   > 
   > <paste your code snippet here>
   > 
   > 
 * Adding Comments & Docstrings:
   > "Generate clear and concise docstrings for the following <language> function/class in <a specific format, e.g., Google-style Python docstrings, JSDoc>. Explain the purpose, arguments, and return value."
   > 
   > <paste your function or class here>
   > 
   > 
 * Writing Unit Tests:
   > "Act as a Quality Assurance engineer. Write unit tests for the following <language> function using the <testing framework, e.g., Jest, pytest>. Cover the primary success case, at least two edge cases, and one error-handling case."
   > 
   > <paste your function here>
   > 
   > 
## For Documentation (READMEs & More)
Good documentation is crucial for any repository. These prompts save you hours of writing.
 * Generating a README from Scratch:
   > "Generate a professional README.md file for my project.
   > Project Name: <Your Project Name>
   > Description: <A one-sentence summary of what your project does>
   > Key Features: <List 3-5 key features as bullet points>
   > Tech Stack: <List the main languages, frameworks, and tools>
   > Include sections for: Introduction, Features, Installation, Usage, and Contributing."
   > 
 * Creating a CONTRIBUTING.md:
   > "Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file for my open-source project. The tone should be welcoming and encouraging. Include sections on:
   > 
   >  * How to Report Bugs
   >  * How to Suggest Features
   >  * How to Set Up the Development Environment
   >  * Pull Request Process (mention that we use Conventional Commits and require tests for new features)."
   > 
## For Commit Messages
Clear and consistent commit messages make your project history understandable.
 * Generating a Commit Message from a Diff:
   > "Act as an expert developer who follows the Conventional Commits specification. Based on the following git diff, write a perfect commit message. The message should have a type, a scope (optional), a short description, and a more detailed body explaining the 'what' and 'why'."
   > 
   > <paste your git diff output here>
   > 
   > 
 * Generating a Commit Message from a Description:
   > "I just made the following changes: <Describe your changes in plain English, e.g., 'fixed the off-by-one error in the pagination logic and added more robust error handling for API calls'>. Write a git commit message for this that follows the Conventional Commits standard."
   > 
## For Repository Strategy & Structure
Use these prompts for higher-level planning and organization.
 * Suggesting a Directory Structure:
   > "I am starting a new <type of project, e.g., Node.js/Express API, React web app, Python data science project>. Suggest a clean, scalable, and conventional directory structure. Provide the structure as a tree and briefly explain the purpose of each top-level directory."
   > 
 * Generating CI/CD Pipelines:
   > "Generate a starter configuration file for <GitHub Actions or GitLab CI> for a <language/framework> project. The pipeline should trigger on pushes to the main branch and do the following:
   > 
   >  * Check out the code.
   >  * Install dependencies.
   >  * Run the linter.
   >  * Execute the test suite."
   > 
By using these targeted and context-aware prompts, you'll get significantly more useful and accurate output from your AI assistant.
