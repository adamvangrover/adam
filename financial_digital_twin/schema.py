"""
This module defines the core schema for the Financial Knowledge Graph.

It uses Python classes to represent the different types of nodes (entities)
and edges (relationships) in the graph, based on the specifications in
Phase 1 and Section 3 of the strategic roadmap.

The schema is intended to be used as a code-based reference for data ingestion,
query generation, and validation.
