## Section 5: The Agentic Framework

The Financial Digital Twin is not just a repository of data; it is an active intelligence partner. This is made possible by the **Agentic Framework**, an LLM-powered application layer that enables users to interact with, query, and understand the digital twin through natural, conversational language.

---

### The "Nexus" Agent

At the heart of the framework is the **Nexus**, a primary AI agent that serves as the central interface for all human interaction with the digital twin. The Nexus agent is designed to be a "virtual analyst," capable of understanding complex questions posed in natural language, translating them into formal queries, and presenting the results in a clear, concise, and context-aware manner.

### Core Capability: Text-to-Cypher

The foundational technical capability of the Nexus agent is **Text-to-Cypher**: the translation of natural language questions into executable Cypher queries for the knowledge graph. This process involves several steps:

1.  **Intent Recognition:** The LLM first parses the user's question to understand the core intent.
2.  **Entity Extraction:** It identifies key business entities mentioned in the query (e.g., "Company A," "all loans maturing next quarter").
3.  **Schema Mapping:** The LLM uses its understanding of our FIBO-aligned ontology to map the extracted entities and intended relationships to the specific nodes, edges, and properties in the graph schema.
4.  **Query Generation:** Using this information, the LLM constructs a syntactically correct and semantically valid Cypher query.

To achieve the enterprise-grade accuracy required for financial services, the base LLM will be **fine-tuned** on a domain-specific dataset of several thousand question-and-query pairs. This ensures the model understands our specific financial jargon, internal acronyms, and the nuances of our data model. Frameworks like **LangChain** or LlamaIndex will be used to structure this process.

### Multi-Agent System Design

To handle the diverse tasks required, we will implement a modular, **multi-agent system**, where specialized agents collaborate to manage the platform. This avoids creating a single, monolithic agent that is difficult to maintain and scale. We will use established design patterns for this system:

*   **Nexus (The Analyst):** This is the primary user-facing agent. It will be built using a **"Single-Agent with Tools"** pattern. Its tools will include the ability to execute Cypher queries, query the TSDB, and call other specialized agents. This provides maximum flexibility for ad-hoc, exploratory analysis.
*   **Ingestion (The Librarian):** This is a background agent responsible for processing and ingesting new data, particularly unstructured documents like regulatory filings or news articles. It will use a **"Sequential Pattern,"** where a document is passed through a series of steps: text extraction, Named Entity Recognition (NER), relationship extraction, and finally, writing the structured output to the graph.
*   **Auditor (The Watchdog):** This is a scheduled agent that runs periodically to perform data quality and compliance checks. It will use a **"Parallel Pattern,"** concurrently running dozens of validation queries against the graph (e.g., "find any loan without a borrower," "identify companies with conflicting risk ratings from different sources"). The results are aggregated into a single report for the data governance team.

### Prompt Architecture and Security

In an agentic system, the library of prompts is a critical, engineered asset that must be managed with the same rigor as application code.

#### LLMOps Best Practices

We will adopt a formal **LLMOps** (Large Language Model Operations) lifecycle for our prompt library:

*   **Version Control:** All prompts will be stored in a dedicated Git repository.
*   **Testing:** Prompts will have unit tests to check for expected outputs and regression tests to ensure changes don't break existing functionality.
*   **Staged Deployments:** Prompts will be deployed through `dev`, `staging`, and `prod` environments.
*   **Cost Monitoring:** We will implement strict monitoring and alerting on token usage and query costs to prevent runaway expenses.

#### Critical Security Considerations

An LLM-powered public interface introduces new security vectors that must be mitigated.

*   **Prompt Injection:** This is an attack where a user inputs malicious text designed to hijack the prompt, causing the LLM to ignore its original instructions and execute the attacker's commands.
*   **System Prompt Leakage:** This occurs when a user tricks the agent into revealing its own system prompt, exposing confidential instructions, context data, or proprietary techniques.

Our defense-in-depth strategy includes:

1.  **Input Sanitization:** Rigorously scan and sanitize all user input to filter out common injection patterns.
2.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** The agent's database credentials must be strictly limited. It should only have read access to the graph, and it should never have access to system-level tables or user credentials.
3.  **Human Oversight:** For any action that modifies data or accesses highly sensitive information, the agent must require explicit confirmation from a human user before proceeding.
