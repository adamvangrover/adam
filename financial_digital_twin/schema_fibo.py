"""
This module defines the core schema for the Financial Knowledge Graph,
aligned with the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO).

This schema co-exists with the legacy `schema.py` and represents the
strategic, enterprise-grade data model for the Digital Twin. It is based
on the mappings defined in `ontology.md`.

The classes are designed to be used as code-based references for data ingestion,
query generation, and validation against the FIBO standard.

# --- Relationships ---
# In a graph, relationships are typically represented as edges.
# In a code-based schema, these can be represented by linking properties
# or dedicated relationship classes if properties are needed on the edge.
# For simplicity, we will imply relationships via linking properties in the nodes
# (e.g., `FinancialReport.company_lei`).
