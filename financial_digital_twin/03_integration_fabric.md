## Section 3: The Integration Fabric

The Financial Digital Twin is a living platform that derives its value from the continuous, automated ingestion of data from a wide array of sources. This section details the architecture of this **integration fabric**, the system responsible for reliably populating and enriching the knowledge graph.

---

### Integration Strategy

The integration strategy is designed for continuous, near-real-time updates. Data will be sourced from both internal and external systems.

*   **Internal Data Sources:**
    *   **CRM System:** Customer profiles, contact history, and relationship data.
    *   **Loan Origination System (LOS):** Loan applications, terms, and borrower details.
    *   **Core Banking Platform:** Transactional data, account balances, and payment histories.
    *   **Internal Watchlists:** Lists of high-risk entities or politically exposed persons (PEPs).

*   **External Data Sources:**
    *   **Market Data Feeds (e.g., Bloomberg, Refinitiv):** Real-time security prices, corporate actions, and reference data.
    *   **Regulatory Filings (e.g., SEC EDGAR):** 10-K, 10-Q, and Form 8-K filings for public companies.
    *   **News APIs (e.g., Factiva, NewsAPI):** Real-time news articles for sentiment analysis and event detection.
    *   **Third-Party Data Providers:** Sanctions lists, beneficial ownership data, and credit ratings.

The process must be fully automated, resilient, and auditable, with robust monitoring and alerting to ensure data freshness and reliability.

### Orchestration Backbone

A powerful workflow orchestrator is required to manage the complex dependencies and scheduling of these data integration pipelines. The orchestrator will be responsible for triggering ingestion workflows, managing retries, handling failures, and providing a clear view of the system's health.

Below is a comparison of leading workflow orchestration tools:

| **Tool**          | **Core Paradigm**                                                               | **Development Experience**                                                                      | **Primary Use Case**                                                                                             |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Apache Airflow**  | **DAGs as Python code.** Traditional, mature, and widely adopted.                 | Configuration-heavy (requires careful setup of schedulers, workers). Steeper learning curve.      | Batch ETL/ELT jobs with complex dependencies and a need for backfilling. The industry standard for many years. |
| **Dagster**       | **Data-aware orchestration.** Views pipelines as graphs of data assets.           | Modern, developer-friendly API with a strong focus on local development, testing, and observability. | Data-intensive applications where data quality, lineage, and testability are paramount. Ideal for complex data platforms. |
| **Prefect**       | **Imperative Python API.** Focuses on simple, dynamic, and observable workflows. | Very intuitive and Pythonic. Easy to get started with. Excellent UI for monitoring and a "no-YAML" approach. | Dynamic, event-driven workflows and applications where developer productivity is a key concern. |

**Recommendation:** For the Financial Digital Twin, **Dagster** is the recommended orchestrator due to its strong focus on data asset lineage and observability, which aligns directly with the regulatory requirements for verifiable data lineage (BCBS 239).

### Deep Dive: Entity Resolution (ER)

The single most critical challenge in the integration fabric is **Entity Resolution (ER)**â€”the process of identifying, matching, and de-duplicating records that refer to the same real-world entity across different data sources. Effective ER is the cornerstone of risk management, preventing fragmented views of exposure and enabling critical functions like Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC), and fraud detection.

#### Matching Methodologies

Two primary methodologies are used for ER:

1.  **Deterministic Matching:** This approach uses a set of fixed, predefined rules to match entities. For example, "match two company records if and only if their Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is identical."
    *   **Pros:** High precision, fast, and easy to explain.
    *   **Cons:** Brittle. Fails if data is missing or has minor variations (e.g., "Corp." vs. "Corporation"). It cannot discover non-obvious matches.

2.  **Probabilistic (Fuzzy) Matching:** This approach uses statistical algorithms (e.g., Jaro-Winkler, Levenshtein distance) to calculate a similarity score between records. Matches are made if the score exceeds a certain threshold.
    *   **Pros:** Flexible and resilient to data entry errors, variations in spelling, and missing data.
    *   **Cons:** Less precise (can generate false positives), computationally more expensive, and can be harder to explain to regulators.

#### A Hybrid, Cascading Strategy

A single approach is insufficient. We will implement a **hybrid, cascading ER strategy** that leverages the strengths of both methods:

1.  **Stage 1 (Deterministic):** First, pass all incoming data through a high-precision deterministic matching engine. Any records that match on a unique, verified identifier (e.g., LEI, CUSIP, Tax ID) are immediately resolved.
2.  **Stage 2 (Probabilistic):** Records that did not find a deterministic match are passed to a probabilistic matching engine. This engine will compare a wider range of attributes (e.g., legal name, address, phone number) to identify likely matches.
3.  **Stage 3 (Human-in-the-Loop):** Matches with a probabilistic score in a "grey area" (e.g., between 85% and 95% confidence) are automatically routed to a data stewardship team for manual review and validation via a dedicated UI. This human oversight is critical for maintaining data quality and providing an auditable decision trail.

This hybrid strategy maximizes accuracy and recall, providing a robust and defensible process for creating a single, authoritative view of every entity in our ecosystem.
