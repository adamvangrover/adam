# Tests

This directory contains the tests for the ADAM system. The tests are written using the `pytest` framework and are used to ensure that the system is working correctly.

## Testing Strategies

The ADAM system uses a variety of testing strategies to ensure the quality and reliability of the code:

### Unit Testing

Unit tests are used to test individual units of code, such as functions and classes. Unit tests are written using the `pytest` framework and are located in the `tests/unit` directory.

### Integration Testing

Integration tests are used to test the interactions between different components of the system. Integration tests are written using the `pytest` framework and are located in the `tests/integration` directory.

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests are used to test the entire system from start to finish. End-to-end tests are written using a combination of `pytest` and other tools, such as `Selenium` and `Behave`. End-to-end tests are located in the `tests/e2e` directory.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, you can use the `pytest` command from the root directory of the repository:

```bash
pytest
```

This will discover and run all of the tests in the `tests/` directory. You can also run specific types of tests by specifying the directory:

```bash
pytest tests/unit
pytest tests/integration
pytest tests/e2e
```

## Writing Tests

When writing new tests, please follow these guidelines:

*   **Use descriptive test names.** The name of the test should clearly indicate what the test is testing.
*   **Write tests for all new code.** Whenever you add new code to the system, you should also add a corresponding test.
*   **Write tests for all bug fixes.** Whenever you fix a bug, you should also add a test that reproduces the bug to ensure that it does not happen again.
*   **Use fixtures.** Use `pytest` fixtures to set up and tear down the test environment.
*   **Use assertions.** Use `pytest` assertions to check that the code is behaving as expected.

By following these guidelines, you can help to ensure that the tests in the ADAM system are comprehensive, reliable, and easy to maintain.
