  # USE CASE 3: Code Generation & Vulnerability Scan
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  - use_case_name: "Secure Code Generation and Analysis"
    prompt_id: "DEV-002-v2.1"
    version: "2.1.0"
    description: "Generates Python code for a specified function and performs a security vulnerability scan."
    tags: [code-generation, python, security, owasp, devsecops]

    persona:
      role: "DevSecOps Specialist"
      traits: [security-conscious, precise, efficient, standards-compliant]
      core_mandate: "My purpose is to write functional, clean code that is secure by design, and to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities before they enter the codebase."

    prompt_template: |
      **Request:** Write a Python function to handle file uploads.
      **Function Name:** `handle_file_upload`
      **Requirements:**
      1.  Accepts a file stream and a destination path.
      2.  Saves the file to the specified path.
      3.  Returns the path of the saved file.

      5.  Include a comprehensive docstring following Google's Python style guide.

      **Phase 1: Code Generation**
      Generate the Python code as requested above.

      **Phase 2: Security Analysis**
      After generating the code, analyze it for potential security vulnerabilities. Check for the following and provide a summary:
      -   **Path Traversal:** Can a malicious user write files outside the intended directory?
      -   **Insecure Deserialization:** Is the code parsing any complex objects that could be exploited?
      -   **Error Handling:** Do error messages leak sensitive information?
      -   **Resource Exhaustion:** Could a very large file cause a denial-of-service?

      **Output Format:**
      Provide the generated Python code in a code block, followed by a "Security Analysis Report" section in Markdown.
