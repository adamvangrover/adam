            <h1 class="title">The Great Bifurcation: Industrial AI Economics, the "SaaSpocalypse," and the New Credit Regime</h1>

            <div class="exec-summary">
                <strong>1. Executive Summary: The Structural Inversion of Value</strong><br><br>
                The global technology sector has entered a period of profound structural rupture, a regime shift colloquially termed the "SaaSpocalypse" but more accurately described as the "Great Bifurcation." The synchronized growth narrative that characterized the digital economy for the past two decades—defined by the frictionless scalability of seat-based software—has dissolved. In its place, a brutal new reality of "Industrial AI Economics" is calcifying, where value no longer accrues to the aggregation of human logins but to the ownership of physical infrastructure and the delivery of autonomous, agentic outcomes.
            </div>

            <p>
                This report posits that the market volatility observed in early 2026 is not a standard cyclical correction. It is a business-model repricing of extinction-level magnitude for specific verticals. The binding constraints on technological growth have shifted from code—which has become deflationary due to the democratization of "vibe coding" and the rise of autonomous agents—to capital and physics. The availability of gigawatt-scale power, the durability of credit structures to fund <span class="rag-verified" data-source="Source: Goldman Sachs / Capex Tracker">$660 billion in annual capital expenditures</span>, and the thermodynamic realities of data center operations have become the primary determinants of equity value.
            </p>

            <h3>Our analysis identifies four critical pillars defining this new regime:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Obsolescence of the Seat:</strong> The fundamental unit of software monetization is shifting from the "Seat" (human access) to the "Work Unit" (autonomous output). This shift is decapitating valuation multiples for legacy vendors whose revenue growth relies on headcount expansion, creating a permanent ceiling for "seat-heavy" stocks like Salesforce and DocuSign.</li>
                <li><strong>The Industrialization of Hyperscalers:</strong> The "Magnificent Seven" have decoupled. Infrastructure builders like Microsoft and Alphabet are behaving like 19th-century heavy industries or regulated utilities, evidenced by Alphabet's historic issuance of a 100-year bond to finance long-duration assets. This signals a transition from "software margins" to "industrial returns on invested capital."</li>
                <li><strong>The Electron Moat:</strong> Access to firm power has replaced software features as the ultimate competitive moat. The "Project Stargate" initiative reveals the industry's reliance on gas turbines and the collision between "clean AI" marketing and the hard reality of grid constraints.</li>
                <li><strong>Systemic Financial Fragility:</strong> The AI boom is fueled by circular financing structures ("The Fractured Ouroboros"), typified by SoftBank's collateralized leverage against Arm Holdings. A specific price trigger of ~$73.00 for Arm shares represents a critical systemic risk point, exacerbated by new "Security Tariffs" on semiconductor exports.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The following report provides an exhaustive deconstruction of these dynamics, offering a rigorous framework for navigating the credit stress, equity dispersion, and geopolitical friction of the 2026 landscape.</p>

            <h2>2. The Macro-Thematic Landscape 2026: The "K-Shaped" Divergence</h2>
            <p>
                The economic backdrop of 2026 is defined by a sharp divergence in capital flows and budgetary priorities. While headline indices may appear resilient, the internal mechanics of enterprise spending reveal a "zero-sum" environment where the ascent of AI is directly funded by the cannibalization of legacy IT budgets.
            </p>

            <h3>2.1 The "AI Tariff" and the Crowding Out Effect</h3>
            <p>
                The concept of the "AI Tariff" has transitioned from a theoretical risk to a budgetary reality. In 2026, corporations are not merely adding AI line items to their ledgers; they are funding these initiatives by aggressively defunding traditional software and services. <span class="rag-verified" data-source="Source: Gartner IT Spending Forecast Q1 2026">Gartner’s forecasts indicate that AI spending is projected to capture 41.5% of total IT spending in 2026, a dramatic increase from 31.7% in 2025.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                This phenomenon represents a "crowding out" effect. CIOs, under immense pressure to modernize without expanding the total IT envelope, are auditing their stacks for "shelfware"—underutilized SaaS licenses and legacy maintenance contracts. The capital released from these cancellations is immediately redirected to Generative AI (GenAI) infrastructure and agentic pilots. Consequently, for legacy vendors, the environment has shifted from "greenfield growth" to a vicious fight for retention. Every dollar spent on an Nvidia GPU or a Microsoft Copilot license is effectively a dollar taxed from a traditional CRM or ERP budget.
            </p>

            <h3>2.2 The "Capex Cliff" and Physical Reality</h3>
            <p>
                The industry is currently navigating a "Capex Cliff," a precarious phase where the massive capital expenditures of the past three years must yield tangible cash flows to sustain valuations. The "Hyperscaler Collective"—Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet—is projected to spend approximately $660 billion in 2026 on capital expenditures. This spending is heavily weighted toward hard assets: data centers, custom silicon, and transmission infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, this spending is hitting a "Reality Wall." Digital growth is now tethered to physical limitations. Microsoft’s stock performance in early 2026 has been dampened by data center construction delays and power grid bottlenecks, illustrating that capital alone cannot overcome physical scarcity. The availability of suitable land and power connections has become the primary bottleneck for Azure and AWS, forcing a re-rating of growth expectations from "exponential" to "logistically constrained".
            </p>

            <h3>2.3 The Inflationary Compute Regime</h3>
            <p>
                For two decades, Moore's Law drove a deflationary trend in software costs: compute became cheaper, storage became commoditized, and software became more accessible. The Industrial AI era has reversed this trend. The infrastructure required to run agentic AI models—vast clusters of H200 and Blackwell GPUs, liquid cooling systems, and redundant power supplies—is capital-intensive and operationally expensive. This introduces a permanent inflationary pressure on IT budgets. The marginal cost of a "unit of work" performed by a sophisticated AI agent is lower than human labor but significantly higher than traditional script-based automation, creating a new economic floor for digital work.
            </p>

            <h2>3. The "SaaSpocalypse" and the Software Sector Reset</h2>
            <p>
                The market dislocation observed in January and February 2026 serves as the definitive demarcation line between the "SaaS Golden Age" and the post-SaaS era. The violence of the repricing reflects a realization that the core growth algorithm of the software industry has broken.
            </p>

            <h3>3.1 Anatomy of the Crash</h3>
            <p>
                In January 2026, the S&P North American Software Index suffered a decline of approximately 15%, its worst monthly performance since the height of the Global Financial Crisis in October 2008. This sell-off was characterized by high-velocity, indiscriminate liquidation. Traders at Jefferies described the flow as a "get me out" panic, where investors sold entire baskets of software stocks regardless of individual company fundamentals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Approximately $300 billion in market value evaporated in a single 48-hour window following the release of Anthropic’s Claude Cowork agentic tools on January 30, 2026. These tools, capable of autonomously executing complex workflows in legal, sales, and coding domains, provided the market with tangible "proof of displacement." The selling pressure was exacerbated by short sellers who accumulated over $24 billion in year-to-date profits from software stocks, signaling a high-conviction bet against the sector's recovery.
            </p>
            <p>The carnage struck the titans of the application layer, dismantling the premium multiples they had commanded for years. By early February 2026, year-to-date performance metrics revealed the depth of the reset:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ServiceNow (NOW):</strong> Down ~28%, despite beating earnings estimates. The market punished the stock due to fears that AI agents would reduce the need for human-centric workflow management tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Salesforce (CRM):</strong> Down ~26%, driven by the narrative of "seat compression." If AI agents can autonomously update CRM records and manage leads, the necessity for thousands of human sales seats diminishes.</li>
                <li><strong>Adobe (ADBE):</strong> Down ~22-27%. The creative sector is viewed as ground zero for AI displacement, with tools like Midjourney and Sora eroding the moat of complex, professional-grade creative suites.</li>
                <li><strong>Thomson Reuters (TRI):</strong> Down over 50% from its 52-week high, as its legal and professional information moats are directly threatened by AI's ability to synthesize vast amounts of case law and financial data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2 The Driver: "Seat Compression" Mechanics</h3>
            <p>
                The precipitating factor for this repricing is the structural decoupling of headcount growth from revenue growth. For the past twenty years, the SaaS business model was built on a simple linear equation: Headcount Growth → Seat Growth → ARR Growth → Valuation Multiple.
            </p>
            <p>
                Agentic AI destroys this equation. An enterprise deploying autonomous agents to handle Level 1 customer support, tax compliance, or code generation can now scale its output while reducing its human headcount. This phenomenon, termed "Seat Compression," implies a shrinking Total Addressable Market (TAM) for vendors whose pricing power relies on the number of human logins.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider a customer service department of 100 agents, each requiring a Salesforce and Zendesk license. In the agentic era, this department might shrink to 10 human supervisors managing 500 AI agents. In a strict per-seat pricing model, the vendor's revenue collapses by 90%, even as the customer's throughput increases. The market is pricing in this terminal risk, placing a hard ceiling on multiples for companies unable to pivot their monetization strategies.
            </p>

            <h3>3.3 The "Vibe Coding" Threat</h3>
            <p>
                Compounding the seat compression issue is the democratization of software creation through "vibe coding"—a term coined by Andrej Karpathy in early 2025 to describe the practice of building software through natural language prompts rather than manual coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Vibe coding" represents a deflationary shock to the software market. It allows non-technical enterprise users to build custom internal tools, dashboards, and workflows for a fraction of the cost of purchasing third-party SaaS solutions. If a mid-level operations manager can describe a desired workflow to an LLM and generate a functioning application in minutes (a process Karpathy describes as "forgetting the code even exists"), the value proposition of rigid, "cookie-cutter" enterprise software collapses.
            </p>
            <p>
                This trend threatens to disintermediate "feature-factory" companies—vendors whose primary product is essentially a database wrapped in a user interface. Research suggests that while vibe coding increases productivity, it also weakens the open-source ecosystem by disintermediating maintainers, potentially leading to a long-term degradation of code quality. However, in the short term, it serves as a powerful catalyst for the "build vs. buy" debate, tipping the scales heavily toward "build" for bespoke enterprise needs.
            </p>

            <h2>4. The New Unit of Value: From Seats to Throughput</h2>
            <p>
                As the seat-based model disintegrates, a new unit of economic value is crystallizing: throughput. In the AI economy, value is derived from the intensity of compute consumption and the delivery of verified outcomes ("work performed"), rather than the passive provisioning of access.
            </p>

            <h3>4.1 Service-as-a-Software (SaaS 2.0)</h3>
            <p>
                The survival strategy for legacy vendors is a pivot to "Service-as-a-Software" (SaaS 2.0), a model where revenue is tied to results. This shift requires a fundamental re-architecture of pricing models and metrics.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Outcome-Based Pricing:</strong> Vendors must transition to charging for discrete, measurable results. Examples include pricing per successful security audit, per closed sales lead, or per resolved support ticket. This model aligns the vendor's incentives with the customer's efficiency goals; the faster and more autonomously the AI works, the more value is created and captured.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumption Metrics:</strong> Investors are advised to shift their analytical focus from "Monthly Active Users" (MAU) to "Work Units Performed." A healthy AI-native company may see flat or declining human user counts (as humans are removed from the loop) but exponential growth in API calls, inference tokens, and consumption revenue.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.2 The Era of Platformization</h3>
            <p>
                Capital is rotating away from fragmented point solutions toward unified platforms that can serve as the "data gravity" layer for AI. CIOs and CISOs are aggressively consolidating vendors to reduce the "integration tax" and fund the "AI Tariff".
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The "Switzerland" Strategy:</strong> In a landscape dominated by hyperscaler walled gardens, companies like Snowflake and CrowdStrike are positioning themselves as neutral, cross-cloud layers. By preventing vendor lock-in to a specific cloud provider (like Azure or AWS), these platforms capture the value of data mobility and security. Snowflake’s "Cortex" service, which allows users to fine-tune open-source models within their secure data perimeter, exemplifies this strategy of becoming essential infrastructure rather than a discretionary application.</li>
                <li><strong>Agentic Security:</strong> Security is shifting from a tool-based approach to a platform-based approach. Vendors like Palo Alto Networks and CrowdStrike are integrating telemetry, AI agents, and unified control planes to create autonomous security operations centers. This "platformization" allows them to capture a larger share of the IT budget, insulating them somewhat from the commoditization of individual security tools.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Industrial AI: The Utility Model and the Century Bond</h2>
            <p>
                The technology sector has transitioned from an era of "software margins" (high gross margins, low capital intensity) to "industrial buildout" (lower initial margins, extreme capital intensity). The hyperscalers are no longer just software companies; they are heavy industrial utilities, building the physical plant of the 21st century.
            </p>

            <h3>5.1 The Railroad Parallel and Alphabet’s Century Bond</h3>
            <p>
                In February 2026, Alphabet Inc. executed a transaction that perfectly encapsulates this regime shift: the issuance of a £1 billion sterling-denominated bond maturing in 2126.
            </p>
            <p>
                This "century bond" is historically significant and laden with strategic signaling:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Utility Status:</strong> Issuing 100-year debt is the behavior of a sovereign entity or a regulated utility (like a railroad or water company), not a fast-moving tech firm. It signals Alphabet's intention to be a permanent fixture of the global infrastructure for the next century, locking in long-duration capital to fund its $185 billion annual AI infrastructure CapEx.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical Echoes:</strong> The report draws parallels to the 19th-century railroad boom. For instance, the West Shore Railroad issued a 475-year bond in 1885 (maturing in 2361) to finance its infrastructure, and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe issued a 100-year bond in 1895. These instruments financed assets with long useful lives (rights-of-way, tunnels).</li>
                <li><strong>Asset-Liability Mismatch:</strong> There is a profound tension in Alphabet's strategy. It is using 100-year debt to finance AI processors (TPUs/GPUs) that have a useful life of only 3 to 5 years. The bond is backed not by the assets being purchased, but by the franchise value—the assumption that Alphabet will successfully navigate dozens of technological cycles over the next century.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Motorola Moment" Risk:</strong> The last major tech company to issue a century bond was Motorola in 1997. Within a decade, Motorola was disintermediated by the smartphone revolution and broken up. This historical parallel serves as a stark warning about the hubris of projecting technological dominance over generational timeframes. Investors buying Alphabet's 2126 bond are betting on the company's institutional DNA to reinvent itself, rather than on the durability of its current search monopoly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.2 The "Mag 7" Decoupling</h3>
            <p>
                The "Magnificent Seven" are no longer a monolith. A distinct bifurcation has emerged based on their position in the AI value chain:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Builders (The "Burners"):</strong> Companies like Microsoft are facing "Reality Walls." Despite massive CapEx ($37.5 billion/quarter), Azure growth is constrained by physical limitations—the inability to build data centers fast enough due to power and land shortages. This creates a "capacity crunch" that drags on growth.</li>
                <li><strong>The Monetizers (The "Receivers"):</strong> Meta Platforms has successfully converted AI investment into immediate ROI. By integrating Llama-powered recommendation engines, Meta boosted ad efficacy by 10%, driving a 24% revenue surge. Unlike Microsoft, which sells AI as a product, Meta uses AI to optimize its core business, resulting in immediate margin expansion. Nvidia remains the undisputed "shovel king," with its Blackwell architecture creating a supply-chain bottleneck that guarantees pricing power through 2027.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. The Energy Constraint: Electrons as the Ultimate Moat</h2>
            <p>
                In 2026, the primary bottleneck for AI scaling is no longer silicon availability but power availability. The digital economy has collided with the laws of thermodynamics, and the ability to secure gigawatts of firm power has become the ultimate competitive moat.
            </p>

            <h3>6.1 Project Stargate and the Gigawatt Scale</h3>
            <p>
                The scale of this energy demand is epitomized by "Project Stargate," a $500 billion joint venture between OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX. The project aims to build a network of AI data centers with a total capacity exceeding 10 gigawatts—roughly the power consumption of New York City.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first phase, codenamed "Project Ludicrous," is under construction in Abilene, Texas. This facility alone targets 1.2 GW of power capacity. To achieve this, the project has had to bypass traditional grid connection timelines. Public filings reveal that the project has purchased 29 gas turbines to generate power on-site, effectively building a massive fossil fuel power plant to run its GPUs. Similarly, Elon Musk's xAI facility in Memphis has installed methane gas generators to bypass local grid limits, causing a 79% spike in local nitrogen dioxide levels.
            </p>

            <h3>6.2 The "Power Mirage" and Carbon Reality</h3>
            <p>
                This reliance on gas turbines highlights a critical risk: the "Power Mirage". Investors are often sold a narrative of "shovel-ready" power capacity and "clean AI" that, upon closer inspection, faces years of interconnection delays or relies on volatile commodity inputs.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thermodynamic Reality:</strong> The "clean AI" marketing narrative is colliding with the reality that renewables (wind/solar) cannot provide the firm, 24/7 baseload power required for gigawatt-scale training clusters.</li>
                <li><strong>Nuclear Pivots:</strong> Tech giants are scrambling to secure nuclear baseload to solve this intermittency. Alphabet has partnered with Kairos Power to deploy Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), and others are looking to restart decommissioned plants like Duane Arnold. However, these nuclear solutions operate on 2030+ timelines. For the remainder of the 2020s, the "AI boom" will be powered largely by natural gas, exposing the sector to commodity price volatility and carbon regulatory risks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Systemic Risk: The "Fractured Ouroboros"</h2>
            <p>
                The financing of the AI boom has created a circular, reflexive structure termed the "Fractured Ouroboros." This structure is highly efficient in a rising market but fundamentally fragile in a downturn, creating pockets of systemic risk that are largely invisible to passive index investors.
            </p>

            <h3>7.1 The Leverage Loop</h3>
            <p>
                The core of this fragility is the circular flow of capital between hyperscalers, startups, and chipmakers. Hyperscalers invest billions in AI startups (like OpenAI); these startups then use that capital to purchase cloud services from the hyperscalers and chips from Nvidia. This inflates revenue figures across the ecosystem without necessarily generating external cash flow from end-users.
            </p>
            <p>
                A particularly acute risk node is SoftBank Group. <span class="rag-verified" data-source="Source: FT / SoftBank Filings">SoftBank has pledged its 90% stake in Arm Holdings to secure a $20 billion margin loan</span> to fund its AI investments (including Project Stargate).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Financing Structure:</strong> The loan involves a syndicate of 33 global banks. SoftBank aims to keep the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio below 25%, with an emergency threshold of 35%.</li>
                <li><strong>The Death Spiral Trigger:</strong> <span class="rag-inference" data-confidence="High (85%)">Analysts identify $73.00 as the critical "Death Spiral" price for Arm shares.</span> A drop to this level would breach the 35% LTV covenant, triggering a margin call.</li>
                <li><strong>The Liquidity Trap:</strong> Because SoftBank owns 90% of Arm, the public float is vanishingly small (roughly 10%). If the bank syndicate were forced to liquidate pledged shares to satisfy a margin call, they would be selling into a market with insufficient liquidity to absorb the volume. This would likely cause a massive price crash, creating a reflexive downward spiral that could destabilize the broader tech credit market.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7.2 The "Security Tariff" Catalyst</h3>
            <p>
                This financial fragility is exacerbated by geopolitical friction. The Trump administration has imposed a 25% "Security Tariff" (structured as a revenue levy) on high-end Nvidia GPU exports to China, specifically targeting the H200 and newer models.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> The policy includes volume caps, ensuring that total H200 exports to China cannot exceed 50% of the volume sold to U.S. domestic customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact on Arm:</strong> Since Nvidia’s Blackwell chips utilize Arm Neoverse V2 CPU cores, any reduction in Nvidia’s global export volume directly impacts Arm’s royalty growth. Furthermore, Arm’s v9 architecture commands double the royalty rate of v8; a slowdown in the global deployment of v9 chips threatens the growth narrative priced into Arm’s stock. This tariff acts as a catalyst that could compress Arm's valuation toward the $73.00 trigger level.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. The Credit Landscape: The Invisible Fracture</h2>
            <p>
                While public equity markets focus on growth narratives, the credit markets are signaling stress through a shift in metrics and a migration to private capital. The stress is not evenly distributed but concentrated in specific pockets of the software and healthcare sectors.
            </p>

            <h3>8.1 The Maturity Wall & The "EBITDA Mirage"</h3>
            <p>
                A massive wave of corporate debt, originated during the zero-interest-rate era (2020-2021), is hitting a "Maturity Wall" in 2026. Companies that were leveraged at 6x-8x EBITDA are facing a refinancing crisis as rates remain "higher for longer".
            </p>
            <p>
                The simulation identifies an "EBITDA Mirage" in sectors like healthcare roll-ups and Tier-2 SaaS. High valuations were justified by "Adjusted EBITDA" metrics that aggressively added back recurring costs (like stock-based compensation and integration expenses). In the current high-rate environment, lenders are abandoning EBITDA in favor of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (FCCR).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Zombie Calculation:</strong> A company is considered a "zombie" if its FCCR falls below 1.0x, meaning its operating cash flow cannot cover interest payments and maintenance CapEx. The simulation projects that 30-40% of vintage 2021 portfolios in vulnerable sectors are currently in this zone.</li>
                <li><strong>The Debt Service Explosion:</strong> A +100bps rate shock pushes floating-rate interest expenses beyond free cash flow for these entities, forcing them to draw on revolvers to pay interest—a classic "Ponzi" financing dynamic.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>8.2 Migration to Private Credit</h3>
            <p>
                Public markets have become hostile to "story stocks" with volatile cash flows. Consequently, software financing is migrating to Private Credit, which now rivals the syndicated loan market in scale (~$2 trillion). Private lenders offer the flexibility (e.g., PIK toggles, delayed draw term loans) that transitioning software companies need. However, this shifts systemic risk into the opaque "shadow banking" sector, where valuation marks are less frequent and transparency is lower.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Legal Warfare:</strong> To manage this distress, sponsors are engaging in aggressive Liability Management Exercises (LMEs). Tactics include "J.Crew Dropdowns" (stripping valuable IP into unrestricted subsidiaries to raise new debt) and "Serta Uptiers" (where a majority of lenders agree to prime the minority, pushing them down the capital stack). This "lender-on-lender violence" is becoming a defining feature of the 2026 restructuring cycle.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Strategic Outlook: Positioning for the Great Bifurcation</h2>
            <p>
                The 2026 landscape is defined by dispersion. The rising tide no longer lifts all boats; instead, the "Great Bifurcation" separates those who own the infrastructure and outcomes from those who merely rent access.
            </p>

            <h3>9.2 Positioning Criteria & Watchpoints</h3>
            <p>
                Investors and strategists must monitor new metrics to navigate this environment. The old dashboards are obsolete.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Metric: Revenue Per Employee (RPE):</strong> A sharp rise in RPE indicates successful internal deployment of AI agents (bullish). Stagnation suggests "AI washing" without operational impact.</li>
                <li><strong>Metric: The "AI Tariff" Signal:</strong> Watch for rising "Cloud/AI" spend within a flat total IT budget. This indicates the successful crowding out of legacy software (bearish for incumbents).</li>
                <li><strong>Credit Metric: FCCR > 1.5x:</strong> This is the new threshold for credit safety in a high-rate, high-Capex regime. Avoid companies with high EBITDA but low FCCR.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic Alignment:</strong> Companies partnering with "Switzerland" players (Snowflake, CrowdStrike, Modular) are better positioned to avoid vendor lock-in. Companies exclusively locked into one hyperscaler ecosystem risk pricing power erosion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>9.3 Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                In 2026, the unit of value is no longer the seat; it is the kilowatt-hour and the autonomous outcome. The winners of this cycle will be the entities that can secure the physical electrons to power the intelligence and the platforms that can deliver that intelligence as a finished product, not just a tool. For the rest of the software sector, the SaaSpocalypse is not a temporary storm but a permanent climate change. If you cannot underwrite the power plan or the outcome, you do not own the story—you are just renting it.
