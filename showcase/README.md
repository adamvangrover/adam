# Adam Mission Control (Showcase)

The `showcase/` directory contains the visual interfaces for interacting with Adam. These are static HTML/JS dashboards that connect to the backend API.

## 🖥️ Key Dashboards

### 1. Neural Dashboard (`index.html` / `neural_dashboard.html`)
The main entry point.
*   **Features:** Real-time stream of agent thoughts ("Intercom"), active system status, and navigation to other modules.
*   **Technology:** Vanilla JS + CSS (Cyberpunk theme).

### 2. Crisis Simulator (`crisis_simulator.html`)
A "War Room" interface for running macro-economic stress tests.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   Inject shocks (e.g., "Liquidity Freeze", "Suez Blockage").
    *   Visualize impact on LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) and CET1 Capital.
    *   Real-time "Risk Radar".

### 3. War Room V2 (`war_room_v2.html`)
A grid-based monitoring station for live market data and system health.
*   **Widgets:** Ticker tape, breaking news feed, active agent list, server latency.

### 4. Deep Dive Reports (`report_*.html`)
Static, high-fidelity renders of Adam's deep dive analyses.
*   **Example:** `report_great_bifurcation_2026.html` - A comprehensive strategic outlook generated by the system.

## 🔌 API Connection

These files expect the Adam backend (Flask) to be running on `http://localhost:5000`.
They interact with endpoints like:
*   `/api/state`: Get current system health.
*   `/api/simulation/start`: Trigger a new scenario.
*   `/api/chat`: Send user queries.

## 🚀 Running the Showcase

You can simply open these files in your browser. For full functionality, ensure the backend is started:

```bash
# In the repository root
python app.py
```
