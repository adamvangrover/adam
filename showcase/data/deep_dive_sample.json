On one side, <strong>Sovereign AI</strong> initiatives led by nation-states (US, China, UAE) are consolidating high-performance compute (HPC) into walled gardens. On the other, <strong>Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN)</strong> are aggregating consumer-grade GPUs into a permissionless grid.</p><p>This 'Bifurcation' creates a unique arbitrage opportunity. While Sovereign clusters command a premium for security and compliance, the DePIN layer offers cost-efficiency for inference and fine-tuning. Our analysis suggests a <strong>60/40 capital allocation shift</strong> towards decentralized protocols by Q4 2026.</p>"
