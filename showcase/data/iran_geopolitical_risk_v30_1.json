        "1. Deterministic Floor Collapse: The IDF launch of preemptive strikes on Tehran (Feb 28, 2026) collapses the sovereign credit floor. Shared National Credit (SNC) rating is downgraded to Substandard/Doubtful due to zero repayment capacity under total blockade.",
        "2. Liquid Trend Decay: Neural ODE analysis of the Rial shows terminal velocity; the currency crossed the 1,000,000:1 USD threshold, vaporizing domestic purchasing power and fueling the 'Phase II' protest wave.",
        "3. Quantum Risk Realization: The 'Succession Qubit' has collapsed from Mojtaba Khamenei toward an IRGC Military Junta led by Ali Larijani/Ghalibaf as 'Crisis Managers' following decapitation threats. This shifts risk from 'Political Instability' to 'Total Regional Attrition'.",
        "4. Supply Chain Viscosity: 2nd-order impact on global markets via the Strait of Hormuz 'Smart Control' exercises threatens 20% of global oil flow, creating a 'Stagflationary Amplitude' for global portfolios."
