        "output": "Rising interest rates typically negatively impact tech growth stocks because their valuations are often based on future cash flows, which are discounted at a higher rate when yields rise. This leads to a compression in P/E multiples. Additionally, higher borrowing costs can hinder expansion plans for capital-intensive tech firms.",

Investment banking revenues rebounded slightly, driven by M&A activity, while trading revenues remained flat. Overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic but wary of potential regulatory headwinds.",

        "output": "A liquidity trap occurs when monetary policy becomes ineffective because nominal interest rates are near zero and consumers prefer to save rather than invest or spend. In the context of 2024, fears arose that despite rate cuts, demand would not recover due to high household debt and pessimistic economic outlooks, rendering central bank stimulus less potent.",

While high ESG scores can mitigate tail risks (e.g., regulatory fines, environmental disasters), they may also limit exposure to high-yield sectors like energy. However, over the long term, ESG-integrated portfolios have shown comparable or slightly superior risk-adjusted returns due to better quality factors.",
