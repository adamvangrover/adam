This architectural principle strictly separates the codebase into two paths to balance Reliability and Velocity.\n\nPath A: The Product (Reliability)\nLocated in `core/agents/`, this path prioritizes stability. Code must use strict typing (Pydantic), defensive programming, and comprehensive logging.\n\nPath B: The Lab (Velocity)\nLocated in `experimental/` and `research/`, this path allows for rapid experimentation and 'breaking things' to discover new capabilities.",
