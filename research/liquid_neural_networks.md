# Liquid Neural Networks

## Overview

Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) are a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for modeling highly dynamic time-series data. LNNs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that use a continuous-time model of computation.

## Potential Applications

LNNs could be used in Adam to:

*   Model highly dynamic financial time-series data, such as stock prices and trading volumes.
*   Improve the accuracy of time-series forecasting tasks.
*   Develop more robust and adaptive trading strategies.

## Challenges

*   **Complexity:** LNNs are more complex than traditional RNNs, which can make them more difficult to train and deploy.
*   **Data requirements:** LNNs may require large amounts of data to train effectively.
*   **Interpretability:** The predictions of LNNs can be difficult to interpret.
