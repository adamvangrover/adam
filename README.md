Adam v23.0: Your AI-Powered PartnerNote: This document describes the current active version of the Adam system (v23.0). For details on the legacy stable version, please see the v21.0 Documentation.🧠 Adam v23.0: The Adaptive Hive MindMission: Autonomous Financial Analysis & Adaptive ReasoningAdam has evolved. v23.0 introduces the "Adaptive System" architecture—a self-correcting, neuro-symbolic engine designed to perform deep financial deep dives, risk assessments, and market simulations with human-like reasoning and machine-speed execution.🚀 Launch Neural Dashboard | 📖 Read the User Guide | ⚡ Quick Start🏗️ System ArchitectureAdam v23.0 moves beyond linear chains to a dynamic, graph-based execution model. The system creates a "Cyclical Reasoning Graph" for every query, allowing it to draft, critique, and refine its own analysis before presenting results.graph TD

Core ComponentsMeta Orchestrator: The central "cortex" that routes tasks and manages state.Neuro-Symbolic Planner: Combines LLM creativity with Knowledge Graph logic to plan execution paths.Cyclical Reasoning Engine: A feedback loop (Draft -> Critique -> Refine) that ensures high conviction.📊 Data & The Gold Standard PipelineGarbage in, garbage out. Adam v23.0 utilizes a rigorous Gold Standard Data Pipeline ("The Universal Ingestor") to ensure all insights are based on verified, high-quality data.Ingestion Sources: Financial news APIs, SEC filings (XBRL), market data feeds, and macroeconomic reports.Scrubbing & Validation: Every data point is scored for "Conviction" (0-100%) based on source reliability and cross-verification.Unified Format: Data is normalized into a standard JSONL format for agent consumption.View Data Pipeline Documentation💡 Example OutputsAdam doesn't just chat; it produces structured, professional-grade financial artifacts.1.

Risk Assessment MatrixAdam automatically generates risk matrices for portfolio stress testing.Risk CategoryProbabilityImpactMitigation StrategyMarketMediumHighHedge via inverse ETFs on semiconductor indices.CreditLowHighMonitor debt-to-equity ratios quarterly; currently stable.GeopoliticalHighSevereDiversify supply chain exposure outside of APAC region.🚀 Key CapabilitiesCyclical Reasoning: Unlike standard chatbots, Adam iterates. If data is missing, it creates a sub-task to find it. If logic is flawed, it self-corrects.Quantum Risk Modeling: (v23.5) Uses Monte Carlo simulations to model "Black Swan" events and their impact on portfolios.Traceability: Every conclusion is back-linked to source documents in the Knowledge Graph (PROV-O ontology compliant).Multi-Modal Output: Generates interactive HTML dashboards, PDF reports, and raw JSON data streams.🛠️ Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.10+Node.js (Required for the Neural Dashboard UI)API Keys: OpenAI (or compatible LLM provider), Neo4j (optional for full KG).Quick Start GuideClone the Repositorygit clone [https://github.com/adamvangrover/adam.git](https://github.com/adamvangrover/adam.git)
