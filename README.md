# Adam v23.0: The Adaptive Hive Mind

> **System Status:** v23.0 (Active) | v21.0 (Stable)
> **Mission:** Autonomous Financial Analysis & Adaptive Reasoning

**Adam has evolved.** v23.0 introduces the **"Adaptive System" architecture**, featuring a self-correcting neuro-symbolic engine that learns from its mistakes, plans complex research paths, and simulates adversarial scenarios.

## 🚀 Mission Control
**[Launch Neural Dashboard](./showcase/index.html)**
*Monitor real-time agent reasoning, knowledge graph updates, and risk simulations.*

## 🌟 Key Capabilities (v23.0)

### 1. Cyclical Reasoning Engine
Unlike traditional linear chains, Adam v23 uses a **cyclical graph** (built on LangGraph) to iterate on analysis.
- **Draft -> Critique -> Refine:** The system critiques its own work and refines it until quality thresholds are met.
- **Self-Correction:** Detects missing data or logical fallacies and automatically launches remedial tasks.

### 2. Neuro-Symbolic Planner
Combines the **creativity of LLMs** with the **logical rigor of Knowledge Graphs**.
- **Path Discovery:** "Plan a path from *Apple Inc.* to *Credit Risk* considering *Supply Chain Constraints*."
- **Traceability:** Every conclusion is back-linked to specific nodes in the PROV-O ontology.

### 3. Hybrid Architecture
- **v21 (Legacy):** Robust, synchronous agents for standard reporting.
- **v22 (Async):** Message-driven microservices for high-throughput data ingestion.
- **v23 (Adaptive):** The "Brain" that orchestrates it all.
