## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adamvangrover/adam.git
    cd adam
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure the System:**

      * System configurations are now managed through a set of modular YAML files within the `config/` directory (e.g., `config/agents.yaml`, `config/api.yaml`, `config/data_sources.yaml`, `config/system.yaml`, `config/settings.yaml`, etc.). 
      * The main `config/config.yaml` file is now deprecated for direct configuration and instead points to these modular files. Users should modify the specific files directly to customize settings.
      * `config/example_config.yaml` can be consulted for examples of various structures but is no longer the primary template to copy for runtime configuration.
      * Configure your preferred LLM engine (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face Transformers, Google Cloud Vertex AI) by modifying the relevant section in the appropriate modular configuration file (e.g., `config/llm_plugin.yaml` or `config/settings.yaml`).
      * Customize agent configurations and workflows by editing files like `config/agents.yaml` and `config/workflow.yaml` to suit your specific needs.

    **3.1. API Key Configuration**

      * API keys for external services are no longer configured in YAML files. Instead, they must be provided as environment variables. The application will read these environment variables at runtime.
      * For instance, you would set environment variables like: `BEA_API_KEY='your_bea_key'`, `BLS_API_KEY='your_bls_key'`, `IEX_CLOUD_API_KEY='your_iex_key'`, `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY='your_twitter_consumer_key'`, etc. 
      * Refer to the specific data source integration or documentation for the exact environment variable names required.

4.  **Run Adam:**

    ```bash
    python scripts/run_adam.py
    ```

## Accessing and Utilizing the Knowledge Graph and API

  * **Knowledge Graph:** Access and query the knowledge graph data directly or through the API. The data is stored in the `data/knowledge_graph.json` file and managed by the Neo4j graph database.
  * **API:** The Adam v19.1 API provides a unified interface for interacting with the system. Refer to the `docs/api_docs.yaml` file for detailed API documentation.
