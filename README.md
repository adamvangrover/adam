# Adam v23.5: Your AI-Powered Partner

> **Note:** This document describes the current active version of the Adam system (v23.0). For details on the legacy stable version, please see the v21.0 Documentation.

---

*   **Cyclical Reasoning Graph:** A self-correcting neuro-symbolic engine.
*   **Neural Dashboard:** Real-time visualization of agent thought processes.
*   **Hybrid Architecture:** Combining v21's reliability with v22's speed and v23's intelligence.
*   **Gold Standard Data Pipeline:** A rigorous "universal ingestion" process that scrubs and certifies all system knowledge.

## 🧠 Adam v23.0: The Adaptive Hive Mind

**Mission: Autonomous Financial Analysis & Adaptive Reasoning**

Adam has evolved. v23.0 introduces the **"Adaptive System" architecture**—a self-correcting, neuro-symbolic engine designed to perform deep financial deep dives, risk assessments, and market simulations with human-like reasoning and machine-speed execution. Unlike traditional chatbots, Adam "thinks" in graphs, critiquing its own work before presenting it to you.

## 🚀 Mission Control
[**Launch Neural Dashboard**](./showcase/neural_dashboard.html)
Monitor real-time agent reasoning, knowledge graph updates, and risk simulations.

### 🏗️ System Architecture

Adam v23.0 moves beyond linear chains to a dynamic, graph-based execution model. The system creates a **"Cyclical Reasoning Graph"** for every query, allowing it to draft, critique, and refine its own analysis before presenting results.

#### Core Components

  * **Meta Orchestrator** (`core/engine/meta_orchestrator.py`): The central "cortex" that routes tasks, manages state, and orchestrates the swarm of specialized agents.
  * **Neuro-Symbolic Planner** (`core/engine/neuro_symbolic_planner.py`): Combines the creativity of LLMs with the logical rigor of Knowledge Graphs to plan execution paths that are both novel and grounded in fact.
  * **Cyclical Reasoning Engine** (`core/engine/cyclical_reasoning_graph.py`): A feedback loop (Draft -\> Critique -\> Refine) that ensures high conviction. It detects logical fallacies or missing data and automatically schedules remedial tasks.

### 📊 Data & The Gold Standard Pipeline

Garbage in, garbage out. Adam v23.0 utilizes a rigorous **Gold Standard Data Pipeline** ("The Universal Ingestor") to ensure all insights are based on verified, high-quality data.

  * **Ingestion Sources:** Financial news APIs, SEC filings (XBRL), market data feeds (Bloomberg/AlphaVantage connectors), and government statistics.
  * **Scrubbing & Validation:** Every data point is scored for "Conviction" (0-100%) based on source reliability and cross-verification against the Knowledge Graph.
  * **Unified Format:** Data is normalized into a standard JSONL format for agent consumption.

### 💡 Example Outputs

### 3. Gold Standard Data Pipeline
A new "Universal Ingestor" ensures that every piece of data in the system is high-quality.

*   **Ingest & Scrub:** Recursively scans reports, prompts, code, and data.
*   **Conviction Scoring:** Automatically assesses the quality and "conviction" of data (0-100%).
*   **Unified Access:** All data is normalized into a standard JSONL format accessible by any agent.
*   [Read the Pipeline Documentation](./docs/GOLD_STANDARD_PIPELINE.md)
Adam doesn't just chat; it produces structured, professional-grade financial artifacts ready for investment committees.

  * **Traceability:** Every conclusion is back-linked to source documents in the Knowledge Graph (PROV-O ontology compliant).
  * **Multi-Modal Output:** Generates interactive HTML dashboards (`showcase/`), PDF reports, and raw JSON data streams.
  * **Specialized Agent Swarms:**
      * *Fundamental Analyst:* Deep value investing analysis.
      * *Technical Analyst:* Chart patterns and momentum indicators.
