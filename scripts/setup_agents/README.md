## Usage Instructions

Each setup agent has its own usage instructions, which can be found within the respective script files. Generally, the usage involves:

1.  **Navigating to the script directory:**  Use the command line or terminal to navigate to the `scripts/setup_agents` directory.
2.  **Executing the script:**  Run the script using the appropriate interpreter or command for the chosen language (e.g., `python setup_agent.py`, `node setup_agent.js`, `bash setup_agent.sh`).
3.  **Following the prompts:**  The script will guide you through the setup process, prompting for necessary information and configuration options.

## Customization

The setup agents can be customized by modifying the script files to adjust parameters, add new functionalities, or integrate with different modules or systems. Refer to the comments within each script file for guidance on customization options.
