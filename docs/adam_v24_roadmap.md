# Adam v24.0 Roadmap: Towards Multimodal Omniscience

## Vision
To evolve Adam from a text-based financial analyst into a **Multimodal, Quantum-Native, Autonomous Investment Architect**.

## Phases

### Phase 1: The Alphabet Foundation (Current - v23.5/v24.0 Alpha)
*   [x] **Gemini 1.5 Pro Integration**: 1M+ token context window for full 10-K analysis.
*   [x] **Structured Reasoning**: "Chain of Thought" extraction of Risk, Strategy, and ESG.
*   [x] **Infrastructure Stubs**: BigQuery and Pub/Sub interfaces defined.
*   [x] **Quantum-Ready**: Quantum Monte Carlo engine architecture established.

### Phase 2: Multimodal Omniscience (v24.1)
*   [ ] **Chart Vision**: Train/Fine-tune Gemini to extract precise data points from financial charts (Bar, Line, Pie).
*   [ ] **Satellite Intelligence**: Integrate satellite imagery analysis (via Gemini Vision) for supply chain monitoring (e.g., counting cars in parking lots, shipping containers).
*   [ ] **Audio Forensics**: Native processing of Earnings Call audio to detect vocal stress markers in CEO responses.

### Phase 3: Cognitive Persistence (v24.2)
*   [ ] **Full RAG Pipeline**: Connect `EpisodicMemory` to a live Vertex AI Vector Search index containing 10 years of global financial filing history.
*   [ ] **Active Learning**: Agents autonomously flag "low confidence" insights for human review, refining the vector store.

### Phase 4: Quantum Supremacy (v25.0)
*   [ ] **QPU Integration**: Replace `SimulatorBackend` in `QuantumMonteCarloEngine` with real Google Quantum AI (Cirq) hardware execution.
*   [ ] **Quantum Approximate Optimization**: Use QAOA for portfolio rebalancing.
