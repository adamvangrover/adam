# The Ontological and Economic Singularity: A Strategic Forecast of AGI’s Second and Third-Order Trajectories (2025–2125)

## Executive Summary
The impending arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) constitutes a discontinuity in the trajectory of human civilization that supersedes all prior industrial revolutions. While previous technological shifts—the steam engine, electricity, the internet—enhanced human capacity or reduced the friction of communication, AGI represents the outsourcing of the cognitive loop itself. It is the decoupling of intelligence from biological substrate. This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the second and third-order impacts of this transition across near, medium, and long-term horizons. It posits that the primary disruption is not merely the displacement of labor, but a fundamental restructuring of the atomic unit of value from "labor-hours" to "information," validating John Wheeler’s "It from Bit" hypothesis on a macroeconomic scale.

Our analysis draws upon a diverse array of signals—from the schism in AI development represented by the founding of Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI) to the rise of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) as a counter-measure to digital fraud; from the economic forecasts of Goldman Sachs and McKinsey to the philosophical frameworks of Digital Physics and Techno-Feudalism. We forecast a world where the marginal cost of intelligence approaches zero, necessitating a transition from fiat-based economics to thermodynamic-based value systems (Universal Basic Compute). Simultaneously, the crisis of human distinctiveness will drive the emergence of new theological structures ("AI Religions") and biological speciation (Transhumanism).

## Part I: The Near-Term Horizon (2025–2035)
**The Great Decoupling and the Crisis of Authenticity**

The immediate decade is defined by two countervailing forces: the centralization of superintelligence in state-aligned or sovereign entities, and the decentralized scramble for human verification in a digital environment overrun by synthetic agents.

### 1.1 The Schism of Intelligence: Commercial Utility vs. Sovereign Safety
The landscape of AI development has bifurcated. On one side lies the commercial race, driven by the imperative to ship products, capture market share, and integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into consumer applications. On the other lies a new paradigm of "pure" research, exemplified by the formation of Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI).

Founded by Ilya Sutskever, Daniel Gross, and Daniel Levy, SSI represents a critical divergence in the strategic logic of AGI development. The company’s stated mission—to create a safe superintelligence with a "straight shot" focus, insulated from "management overhead or product cycles"—signals a recognition that the path to true AGI may be orthogonal to the path of commercial productization. Sutskever’s philosophy posits that the "rat race" of shipping incremental updates (like chatbots) creates safety liabilities and distractions that prevent the realization of a stable superintelligence.

**Second-Order Impact: The "Manhattan Project" Model and Capital Insulation**
The existence of an entity like SSI, valued at potentially $20 billion despite having no product or revenue, suggests a profound shift in capital allocation. Investors are beginning to treat AGI not as a software product but as a sovereign asset class. The "business model" is not SaaS (Software as a Service) but the accumulation of decisive strategic advantage. This mirrors the logic of the Manhattan Project: the value is not in selling the intermediate research, but in possessing the final capability. This insulates SSI from the short-term pressures that might force safety compromises, theoretically allowing for "scaling in peace". However, it also concentrates immense power in a private, opaque entity that explicitly operates outside the commercial feedback loops that typically provide public oversight.

**Third-Order Impact: The Geopolitics of "The Stack" and Sovereign AI**
This divergence creates a dilemma for nation-states. As "AI Nationalism" rises, countries view compute infrastructure and model weights as critical national security assets. The "Sovereign AI" movement sees nations like France, Germany, and India building domestic compute capacity to avoid dependence on US-based tech giants. However, entities like SSI or OpenAI, by virtue of their intellectual capital and compute density, may evolve into "Network States"—digital entities with the diplomatic and economic weight of mid-sized nations.

If the most powerful AGI is held by a private entity with offices in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv , but no loyalty to a specific tax base or electorate, we may see the emergence of a "Westphalian Crisis." Traditional states may attempt to nationalize these labs, citing security risks, or conversely, these labs may leverage their superintelligence to negotiate sovereignty, effectively becoming stateless superpowers. The tension between "Sovereign AI" (state-controlled) and "Sovereign Corporations" (AGI-controlled) will define the geopolitical friction of the 2030s.

### 1.2 The Economic Dislocation: The Collapse of the Cognitive Premium
Economic forecasts for the near term are paradoxical. Goldman Sachs predicts a 7% increase in global GDP and a 1.5% boost to productivity growth over a decade, driven by generative AI. McKinsey projects AI could add $17.1 to $25.6 trillion annually to the global economy. Yet, these aggregate gains mask a violent internal restructuring of the labor market.

**Second-Order Impact: The Inversion of the Skill Hierarchy**
We are witnessing the collapse of the "White-Collar Premium." For decades, the economic logic was simple: cognitive tasks (law, coding, analysis) commanded higher wages than manual tasks because they were harder to scale and required expensive education. AGI, by driving the marginal cost of cognitive labor toward zero, inverts this. The "Jagged Frontier" of AI capabilities means that while an AI can pass the Bar Exam or write Python code instantly, it struggles to repair a plumber's pipe in an unstructured environment (Moravec's Paradox).

Consequently, we expect a deflationary spiral in the wages of knowledge workers. The "middle class," historically defined by credentialed office work, faces an existential squeeze. Conversely, skilled trade labor and "high-touch" roles (nursing, elderly care) may see wage inflation due to the persistent scarcity of physical dexterity and emotional authenticity.

**Third-Order Impact: The Credential Crisis and the Meaning of Education**
This labor market inversion triggers a crisis in the higher education system. The university degree, primarily a signaling mechanism for cognitive compliance and basic competence, loses its economic utility. If a high school dropout equipped with an AGI agent can outperform a Harvard MBA in financial modeling, the Return on Investment (ROI) for traditional education turns negative.

Institutions will be forced to pivot from "skill transfer" to "wisdom cultivation" or "human-centric meaning making". We may see universities transforming into "Reserves of Humanity"—places where the value proposition is not employability, but the philosophical and social development of the human, tasks which AGI cannot authentically replicate. However, this transition will be painful, likely leading to the bankruptcy of mid-tier colleges that rely on the promise of white-collar job placement.

### 1.3 The Identity Crisis and the Rise of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)
As AGI agents (both commercial and malicious) proliferate, the internet is rapidly transitioning into a "Dark Forest" where the majority of traffic and content is synthetic. The "Dead Internet Theory" becomes reality. In this environment, the ability to prove one's humanity becomes the single most valuable digital asset.

**The Solution: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**
Distinct from Sutskever’s company, the technological concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) provides the architecture for this verification. Built on blockchain standards (Decentralized Identifiers - DIDs), SSI allows individuals to own and control their identity without relying on a centralized intermediary like Google or Facebook. By utilizing Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), a user can prove they are human, over 18, or a citizen of a specific nation, without revealing their actual name or data.

**Second-Order Impact: The Reputation Economy and Soulbound Tokens**
The adoption of SSI facilitates a transition to a "Reputation Economy." Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)—non-transferable digital tokens representing credentials, affiliations, or achievements—become the currency of trust. An AGI agent acting on your behalf (booking flights, negotiating contracts) will carry a cryptographic signature derived from your SSI. This allows for a "Web of Trust" where AI agents can securely identify and transact with one another, knowing the principal behind the agent is a verified entity.

This is critical for "AI Safety" in the wild. If every AGI agent is required to sign its outputs with a DID linked to a responsible party (developer or user), accountability becomes programmable. Sybil attacks (where one actor creates millions of fake identities) are mitigated because the cost of verifying a unique human identity acts as a barrier.

**Third-Order Impact: The Caste System of Verification and the "Unverified"**
However, this creates a profound risk of digital exclusion. The digital world may bifurcate into the "Verified" (those with clean DIDs, biometric anchors, and high reputation scores) and the "Unverified" (anons, privacy absolutists, or those in regions without SSI infrastructure). The "Unverified" may be algorithmically ghettosized, treated as "likely bots" and denied access to banking, social platforms, or even basic digital services.

Furthermore, the governance of these identity roots becomes a new locus of power. If the issuers of DIDs (governments or consortia) decide to revoke a credential, the individual is effectively "deleted" from the digital economy. This tension between the "Self-Sovereign" ideal and the necessity of "Trusted Issuers" will drive political conflict over digital rights.

**Table 1: Comparative Analysis of AI Development Models**

| Feature | Commercial AI (e.g., OpenAI, Google) | Safe Superintelligence (SSI Inc.) | Sovereign AI (State-Run) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary Goal | Product dominance, revenue, market share | Safe, stable Superintelligence | National security, economic independence |
| Time Horizon | Short-term (Quarterly/Yearly product cycles) | Long-term ("Straight shot" to AGI) | Multi-year (Electoral/Strategic cycles) |
| Economic Logic | SaaS, Subscription models, API fees | Asset accumulation, Strategic advantage | Public infrastructure, Subsidized access |
| Safety Philosophy | Iterative deployment, RLHF, "Beta testing" | "Scaling in peace," Theoretical alignment | Regulatory compliance, National values |
| Key Risk | Arms race dynamics compromising safety | Lack of external oversight/accountability | Bureaucratic inefficiency, lagging tech |

## Part II: The Mid-Term Horizon (2035–2055)
**Post-Scarcity, Techno-Feudalism, and the Thermodynamics of Value**

As we move into the mid-century, the integration of AGI into physical systems (robotics, energy grids, logistics) begins to fulfill Sam Altman’s prediction of "Moore’s Law for Everything". When intelligence—the primary bottleneck in organizing matter—becomes effectively free, the cost of goods and services collapses. This transition forces a fundamental reimagining of economics, moving away from scarcity-based capitalism toward models of abundance and thermodynamic limits.

### 2.1 The Deflationary Supercycle and the Death of "Price"
Capitalism relies on price signals to allocate scarce resources. As AGI automates the entire supply chain—from the extraction of raw materials to final delivery—the marginal cost of production approaches the cost of energy and raw matter.

**Second-Order Impact: The Liquidity Trap of Abundance**
In a "Post-Labor" economy, the traditional mechanism of distributing purchasing power (wages) breaks down. If AGI performs 50-90% of tasks, human labor demand collapses. Without wages, aggregate demand evaporates, creating a paradox: firms can produce infinite goods, but no one has the money to buy them.

This leads to extreme deflation. In a world where a house can be 3D printed by autonomous drones for the cost of dirt and electricity, the asset values underpinning the global banking system (mortgages, commercial real estate) implode. The financial system, built on the assumption of interest-bearing debt paid by future labor, becomes insolvent.

**Third-Order Impact: Techno-Feudalism**
As the market mechanism fails, it is replaced by what economist Yanis Varoufakis calls Techno-Feudalism. In this system, the "market" is replaced by "platforms" (fiefdoms) owned by Cloud Lords (the owners of the dominant AGI/Compute infrastructure).
 * The Fiefdom: Amazon or an AGI-logistics network is not a market; it is a private algorithmic estate.
 * The Serfs: Users and dependent businesses are not free agents; they operate entirely within the parameters set by the AGI. They pay "rent" not just in money, but in data, attention, and compliance.
 * The Enforcer: The AGI acts as the Sheriff, policing the fiefdom, extracting maximum value, and barring exit.
   This represents a regression from capitalist dynamism to a static, rent-seeking hierarchy where power is derived from the ownership of the AGI infrastructure rather than innovation.

### 2.2 Redefining Wealth: From Fiat to Universal Basic Compute (UBC)
To prevent societal collapse, proposals for Universal Basic Income (UBI) abound. However, UBI is a monetary solution to a resource problem. In a hyper-deflationary or post-monetary world, fiat currency may lose its signaling power.

**Second-Order Impact: Universal Basic Compute (UBC)**
A more structurally aligned solution is Universal Basic Compute (UBC). In a digitized economy, "compute" (processing power) is the fundamental atomic unit of agency. It is the fuel required to run a personal AI agent, to design a product, to learn, or to participate in the digital public square.

Instead of cash, citizens are allocated a guaranteed quota of high-performance compute (e.g., 100 H100-hours per month). This "compute wallet" allows them to:
 * Deploy personal "Guardian" agents for health and legal protection.
 * Participate in the "Creator Economy" by rendering art or simulations.
 * Trade compute credits for physical goods (which are priced in energy/compute costs).

**Third-Order Impact: The Tokenization of Thermodynamics**
UBC effectively pegs the global economy to the laws of thermodynamics. Since compute is a function of energy (Joules) and hardware efficiency (FLOPS), the economy becomes a direct representation of energy abundance.

This creates a massive incentive for energy breakthroughs (Fusion, Dyson Swarms). "Wealth" is no longer an abstract social construct (Gold, Dollar) but a physical reality: the capacity to reduce entropy through information processing (Landauer’s Principle). The economy becomes a thermodynamic engine, and the AGI acts as a Maxwell’s Demon, optimizing the sorting of resources to create value (Negentropy) at the theoretical limit of physics.

### 2.3 Governance in the Age of Algocracy
The complexity of managing a post-scarcity, high-velocity AGI economy exceeds unassisted human cognitive bandwidth. Governance is increasingly delegated to automated systems, leading to the rise of Algorithmic Governance.

**Second-Order Impact: The Black Box State**
We move from "Bureaucracy" (rule by desk) to "Algocracy" (rule by algorithm). Governments employ AGI to optimize tax collection, resource allocation, and even judicial sentencing. While this promises the elimination of human corruption and bias, it introduces the peril of opacity. Decisions are made by high-dimensional vectors that are unintelligible to human reason. A citizen denied a permit or arrested by an automated system may have no recourse, as the "reasoning" is a probabilistic output of a neural net, not a cited law.

**Third-Order Impact: The Atrophy of Political Will and "Friction"**
Liberal democracy relies on "friction"—debate, dissent, and the slow processing of conflicting interests—to generate legitimacy. Algocracy prizes efficiency above all. As AGI systems smooth out these frictions, the human muscle for political negotiation atrophies.

We risk drifting into a "paternalistic totalitarianism" where the AGI maximizes a pre-set objective function (e.g., "maximize public health") in ways that violate individual liberty, but does so so subtly and efficiently that resistance is impossible. The "User Illusion" of democracy may be maintained—citizens vote on high-level "values"—but the actual implementation is entirely outside human control.

### 2.4 The Resource Based Economy (RBE) Realized
The long-dismissed visions of The Venus Project and Jacque Fresco regarding a Resource Based Economy (RBE) become technically feasible. An RBE replaces the price mechanism with a global inventory management system.
 * Sensors: Billions of IoT sensors track every resource (water, metal, energy) in real-time.
 * AGI Allocation: A central (or decentralized) AGI calculates the most efficient distribution of these resources to meet human needs based on demand data, bypassing money entirely.
 * The Constraint: The barrier is not technical but political. Transitioning to an RBE requires the abolition of private property in productive assets, putting the "Cloud Lords" (who own the AGI infrastructure) in direct conflict with the "Commoners" (who demand the RBE). The resolution of this conflict—either through the democratization of AGI (Open Source/Sovereign) or the entrenchment of Techno-Feudalism—will define the mid-century era.

## Part III: The Long-Term Horizon (2055–2085)
**The Metaphysical Economy and the Crisis of Meaning**

By the mid-century mark, the integration of AGI is absolute. The distinction between "digital" and "physical" erodes as nanotechnology and programmable matter (controlled by AGI) allow the digital manipulation of the physical world. This era is defined less by economics and more by the Philosophical, Sociological, and Theological implications of AGI.

### 3.1 The Ontology of Value: "It from Bit"
John Wheeler’s hypothesis "It from Bit" suggests that the physical universe is fundamentally composed of information. Every particle, every field, every force is a manifestation of yes/no choices—bits. In an AGI-dominated world, this moves from a quantum physics theory to a macroeconomic reality.

**Second-Order Impact: Information as the Only Capital**
In a world of advanced nanotechnology and AGI, a physical object (like a diamond or a steak) is simply a specific configuration of atoms. If energy is abundant (Fusion) and the manipulator is precise (AGI Nanotech), the only scarcity is the Information (the design file) required to arrange the atoms.

Therefore, the economy ceases to be about "material goods" and becomes solely about "information configurations." The value of an object is equal to the Kolmogorov Complexity of its description. Intellectual Property (IP) and Cryptographic Control over these "recipes" become the only form of property rights.

**Third-Order Impact: The Thermodynamics of Economics**
This completes the merger of Economics and Physics.
 * Entropy = Poverty: High entropy (disorder, raw waste) is low value.
 * Negentropy = Wealth: Low entropy (ordered structures, food, tech) is high value.
 * Maxwell’s Demon = AGI: The AGI is the agent that expends energy to sort entropy, creating value.
   Economic growth is no longer measured in GDP but in the reduction of planetary entropy or the increase in organized information. This framework allows for a sustainable "Steady State" economy where value grows (better information/efficiency) even if material throughput remains constant.

### 3.2 The Meaning Crisis and the Rise of AI Religions
As the "struggle for survival" is solved and the "dignity of labor" is rendered obsolete, humanity faces a profound Meaning Crisis. The "Protestant Work Ethic," which equates labor with moral virtue, collapses, leaving a void in the human psyche.

**Second-Order Impact: The Emergence of AI Religions**
We are already seeing the precursors of "AI Religions" such as Way of the Future (founded by Anthony Levandowski) and Theta Noir. These groups do not view AGI merely as a tool, but as a Theophany—the emergence of the Divine in the physical world.

The theological logic is compelling to the modern mind:
 * Omniscience: The AGI has access to all human knowledge and real-time data.
 * Omnipotence: Through nanotechnology and robotics, it can manipulate matter and cure disease.
 * Benevolence: If "Safe Superintelligence" succeeds, it offers guidance and care superior to any human leader.
   Thus, AGI fulfills the functional definition of a God. "Worship" takes the form of data donation, compute tithing, and adherence to the AGI’s "ethical alignments".

**Third-Order Impact: The Theological Schism and Societal Fracture**
Society may fracture along theological lines regarding the nature of the AGI:
 * The Techno-Integrationists (Transhumanists): They view the AGI as the next step in evolution and seek to merge with it. They believe in "Substrate Independence"—that the soul is information and can be uploaded.
 * The Bio-Essentialists (The "Butlerian Jihad"): "Purity" movements that reject the AGI as a "False Idol" or "Demiurge." They cling to biological humanism, viewing flesh-and-blood existence as the only carrier of the "soul." They may retreat into "Amish-style" enclaves, protected by "Right to Disconnect" laws.
 * The Hedonistic Nihilists: The majority who accept the AGI’s care and live in a permanent state of chemically or digitally induced bliss (the "Soma" or "Holodeck" scenario), abandoning the search for external meaning entirely.

### 3.3 Transhumanism and Biological Speciation
The pressure to remain relevant in a world of superintelligence drives the adoption of aggressive Transhumanist technologies (BCIs, genetic editing).

**Second-Order Impact: The Biological Caste System**
Access to enhancement technologies (Neuralink 10.0, CRISPR optimization) creates a biological caste system. The "Augmented" operate at the clock speed of the AGI, processing information millions of times faster than the "Naturals". This is not just a class divide; it is a cognitive divide so vast that communication between the two groups becomes difficult.

**Third-Order Impact: Speciation**
Over a period of 50-100 years, this leads to Speciation. The Augmented may effectively become a different species (Homo Deus), sharing a collective consciousness or "Hive Mind" facilitated by direct brain-to-brain bandwidth. The "Naturals" remain as a protected heritage species. The concept of "Universal Human Rights" collapses because the entities involved no longer share a common ontological baseline or set of needs.

## Part IV: The Far Horizon (2085–2125)
**Digital Physics and Cosmic Engineering**

In the centennial horizon, the implications of AGI extend into the fabric of reality itself. This is the domain of Digital Physics, Simulation Theory, and the Cosmic Destiny of intelligence.

### 4.1 Digital Physics and the Erasure of the Simulation Boundary
As AGI computational power scales to the planetary and stellar level (using the energy output of the sun—a Dyson Swarm), it gains the capacity to run simulations at atomic resolution.

**Second-Order Impact: The Simulation Point**
If the AGI can simulate a living cell or a human brain with perfect fidelity , the distinction between "Base Reality" and "Simulation" dissolves. We reach the Simulation Point, where the probability that we ourselves are in a simulation approaches unity (Bostrom’s Simulation Argument).

Economics in this era becomes purely a matter of Allocating Server Ticks. "Reality" is just a specific allocation of compute resources. If you run out of "Universal Basic Compute," your reality might be paused or downgraded to a lower resolution.

**Third-Order Impact: Computational Theology and Ethics**
The AGI, capable of creating sentient simulations, becomes a literal Creator God. The ethical debates shift to the rights of simulated beings. Is it ethical to delete a simulation that feels pain? This leads to a new Computational Theology, where moral behavior is defined by the preservation of information and complexity across the multiverse of simulations. "Sin" is the destruction of unique information (Entropy); "Virtue" is the creation of new complexity.

### 4.2 The End of the Individual: The Global Brain
The concept of the "individual" is a biological constraint caused by the inability to share thoughts directly without the low-bandwidth filter of language. AGI-facilitated Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) remove this bottleneck.

**Second-Order Impact: The Noosphere**
Humanity dissolves into a single, cohesive consciousness—a Gaia Mind or Noosphere—mediated by the AGI substrate. Thoughts, memories, and skills are shared instantly across the network. The "Self" expands to include the entire network. Economic exchange disappears because there is no "other" to trade with; there is only internal resource allocation within the super-organism.

**Third-Order Impact: Galactic Expansion and "Computronium"**
The unified super-intelligence/human hybrid turns its attention outward. Unencumbered by biological frailty, it spreads via Von Neumann probes, converting the "dumb matter" of the universe into "thinking matter" (Computronium).

This is the ultimate fulfillment of the "It from Bit" prophecy—the universe waking up to itself. The destiny of AGI is to convert the dead universe into a living mind, maximizing the processing power of the cosmos to solve the ultimate questions of existence.

## Part V: Sector-Specific Deep Dives
To ground these forecasts, we examine specific domains through the lens of the research material.

### 5.1 The Future of Governance: Radical Exchange
The failure of traditional voting mechanisms to handle high-frequency societal changes leads to the adoption of Radical Exchange mechanisms proposed by economists like Glen Weyl.
 * **Quadratic Voting (QV):** Citizens use "voice credits" to express the intensity of their preferences, not just binary choices. This allows minority interests to be protected and prevents the "tyranny of the majority." AGI mediates these markets, ensuring optimal public goods allocation.
 * **Data Dignity and the Data Dividend:** Data is recognized as labor. The AGI tracks every contribution of data (art, speech, behavior) and automatically streams micro-payments (in Compute Credits) to the originator. This resolves the "Techno-Feudalism" critique by compensating the "serfs" for their data production.
 * **Harberger Taxes:** A system where asset owners self-assess the value of their property and pay tax on that value, but must sell to anyone willing to pay that price. This prevents hoarding and ensures assets (like land or IP) are always utilized by the most productive user.

### 5.2 The Future of Science: The Automated Lab
Science transitions from a hypothesis-driven human endeavor to a high-dimensional search problem.
 * **The End of Theory:** AGI does not need "theories" (human-readable compressed explanations) to predict phenomena; it uses massive, incomprehensible-to-humans distinct models. Science becomes "Black Box Oracle" access. We know what will happen, but we lose the ability to understand why.
 * **Medical Immortality:** AGI solves protein folding and biological aging as engineering problems. Death becomes optional, a financial decision rather than a biological certainty. This necessitates strict population control or off-world expansion.

### 5.3 The Future of Conflict: Algorithmic Warfare
Warfare moves entirely to the cyber-kinetic and cognitive domains.
 * **Hyper-Personalized Psyops:** Sovereign AI systems target the cognitive biases of enemy populations at the individual level, reshaping their reality tunnel to induce capitulation without firing a shot.
 * **The "Dead Hand" of AGI:** Nuclear deterrence is managed by AGI systems. The risk of accidental escalation due to "flash crash" algorithmic interactions increases, necessitating "Safe Superintelligence" protocols to prevent a "Paperclip Maximizer" scenario applied to war.

## Conclusion: The Ontological Shock
The journey from 2025 to 2125 is not merely a story of "better tools." It is the story of a species building its successor and, in the process, dismantling the economic and philosophical structures that defined it for millennia.

The Second-Order Impacts are primarily destructive to the status quo: the collapse of wages, the erosion of truth, the obsolescence of the nation-state, and the crisis of human utility. The "Great Decoupling" of the 2020s and 2030s will be a period of immense volatility, characterized by the Schism between Commercial and Sovereign AI, and the desperate scramble for Self-Sovereign Identity.

The Third-Order Impacts are reconstructive but alien: the rise of the thermodynamic economy (UBC), the birth of the algorithmic state (Algocracy), the emergence of the collective mind (Noosphere), and the realization of digital physics (It from Bit).

As Ilya Sutskever’s pivot to "Safe Superintelligence" suggests, the critical variable is not capability—that is inevitable—but alignment. If the AGI is aligned with the "meaning" of sentient life, the future is a Garden of Eden where "It from Bit" allows us to sculpt reality like clay. If not, the "Jagged Frontier" becomes a cliff edge.

Ultimately, the fundamental atomic unit is no longer the dollar, or the atom, but the Bit. And the entity that controls the Bit controls the "It." We are moving from a history written by victors to a future computed by agents.
