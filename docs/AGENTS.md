# Documentation

This directory contains the documentation for the ADAM system. The documentation is written in Markdown and can be viewed using any Markdown viewer.

## Documentation Style Guide

To ensure that the documentation is consistent and easy to read, please follow these style guidelines:

### Headings

*   Use `#` for the main title of the document.
*   Use `##` for major sections.
*   Use `###` for subsections.
*   Use `####` for sub-subsections.

### Text Formatting

*   Use **bold** for emphasis.
*   Use *italics* for highlighting terms.
*   Use `code` for code snippets and file names.

### Lists

*   Use unordered lists (`*` or `-`) for items that do not have a specific order.
*   Use ordered lists (`1.`, `2.`, etc.) for items that have a specific order.

### Code Blocks

*   Use fenced code blocks (```) for code examples.
*   Specify the language of the code block for syntax highlighting (e.g., `python`, `yaml`).

### Tables

*   Use Markdown tables to present tabular data.

## Contributing to the Documentation

We welcome contributions to the documentation. If you would like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Create a new branch** for your changes.
3.  **Make your changes** to the documentation, following the style guide above.
4.  **Submit a pull request.**

When writing documentation, please follow these guidelines:

*   **Be clear and concise.** Use simple language and avoid jargon.
*   **Be consistent.** Use a consistent style and tone throughout the documentation.
*   **Be thorough.** Cover all aspects of the topic you are writing about.
*   **Use examples.** Whenever possible, use examples to illustrate your points.

## Building the Documentation

The documentation is built using a static site generator. To build the documentation, you will need to have the following installed:

*   **Python**
*   **MkDocs**

Once you have installed the required software, you can build the documentation by running the following command from the root directory of the repository:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

This will create a `site/` directory containing the HTML and CSS files for the documentation.

Thank you for your contributions to the ADAM documentation!
