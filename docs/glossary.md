# Adam Glossary

A dictionary of terms used within the Adam v26.0 ecosystem.

## A
*   **Adam:** The name of the entire system ("Autonomous Deterministic Analytical Machine").
*   **Adjudicator:** The engine responsible for running crisis simulations and declaring "winners" in adversarial scenarios.
*   **Agentic Oversight Framework (AOF):** The security layer that prevents agents from taking unauthorized high-risk actions.

## C
*   **Consensus Engine:** The module that aggregates conflicting opinions from multiple agents to form a single executive decision.
*   **Conviction Score:** A 0-100% metric indicating how confident an agent is in its conclusion. Below 85% usually triggers a review or "Low Conviction" flag.

## G
*   **Graph Engine (System 2):** The synchronous, stateful part of the system (using LangGraph) designed for deep reasoning and planning.
*   **Grounding:** The practice of citing specific sources (documents, URLs) for every claim generated by an agent.

## H
*   **HNASP:** "Hyper-Dimensional Neuro-Associative Semantic Perceptron". A theoretical construct for how Adam maps concepts in its vector space.
*   **Hybrid Architecture:** The combination of the fast, async Swarm (System 1) and the slow, deep Graph (System 2).

## M
*   **Meta Orchestrator:** The central router that receives user queries and decides which subsystem (Graph vs. Swarm) should handle them.

## N
*   **Neuro-Symbolic:** AI that combines Neural Networks (LLMs) for intuition with Symbolic Logic (Rules/Code) for precision.

## P
*   **Prompt Library (AOPL):** The repository of versioned instructions (`.md` files) that define agent personas.

## S
*   **Swarm (System 1):** The asynchronous collection of specialized workers (e.g., News Bot) that perform high-speed, independent tasks.
*   **System Prompt:** The "God Instruction" that defines an agent's core personality and constraints.

## U
*   **Universal Ingestor:** The ETL pipeline responsible for cleaning, redacting, and vectorizing incoming data.
