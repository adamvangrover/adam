# Adam v23.5 Showcase Updates

## Overview

The v23.5 "AI Partner" upgrade introduces significant enhancements to the Adam Showcase (Mission Control), focusing on deep financial analysis, system deployment simulations, and interactive knowledge graph visualization. These updates transform the static showcase into a high-fidelity "Digital Twin" of the full application's capabilities.

## New Modules

### 1. Deep Dive Analyst (`showcase/deep_dive.html`)

A specialized interface designed to visualize the output of the v23.5 **Deep Dive Protocol**. This module acts as the frontend for the "Omniscient Analyst" persona.

*   **Purpose**: To provide a granular, interactive view of the 5-phase analysis pipeline:
    1.  Entity Resolution & Ecosystem Mapping
    2.  Deep Fundamentals & Valuation
    3.  Credit Analysis & SNC Ratings
    4.  Risk Modeling & Quantum Simulation
    5.  Strategic Synthesis & Conviction
*   **Key Features**:
    *   **Valuation Widgets**: Interactive bar charts and gauges displaying DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) and Market Multiples.
    *   **Risk Dashboard**: Visualizers for Monte Carlo simulations (volatility paths) and Quantum Risk metrics (tail risk probability).
    *   **Report Synthesis**: A structured, readable view of the complex `v23_knowledge_graph` JSON output.
    *   **Export Capabilities**: "Print / Save as PDF" functionality for generating professional investment memos.

### 2. Deployment Console (`showcase/deployment.html`)

A simulated environment for managing the lifecycle of the Adam system, designed to demonstrate the "DevOps" and "System Architect" capabilities of the platform.

*   **Terminal Simulation**: A realistic, scrolling terminal interface that displays simulated build logs, deployment status messages, and system health checks. It provides visual feedback for background processes.
*   **File Editor**: A mock code editor (with syntax highlighting) that allows users to "view" and "edit" configuration files and scripts directly in the UI, demonstrating the system's transparency.
*   **Repo Explorer**: An integrated file tree view of the repository structure, powered by the `window.REPO_DATA` object generated by the Universal Ingestor.

## Core Updates

### Reports Engine (`showcase/reports.html`)

The Reports engine has been significantly upgraded to support the new v23.5 data schema.

*   **Hyper-Dimensional Knowledge Graph (HDKG) Support**: The engine now automatically detects if a JSON report follows the `v23_knowledge_graph` schema.
*   **Dynamic Section Rendering**: Instead of a flat text dump, the UI dynamically builds tabbed sections for "Entity Ecosystem", "Equity Analysis", "Credit & SNC", "Simulation", and "Strategy", parsing the nested JSON structure into readable tables and charts.

### React Integration

The Showcase now serves as a conceptual bridge to the full React application located in `services/webapp/client`.

*   **Component Mirroring**: Key React components, such as the `KnowledgeGraphVisualizer` and `ConvictionMeter`, are visually represented in the static HTML pages to demonstrate their functionality without requiring a full Node.js backend.
*   **Unified Design System**: The "Cyber-Minimalist" aesthetic—characterized by dark mode, glassmorphism, scan-lines, and a Neon Cyan palette—has been unified across both the static Showcase and the React App.

## Data Pipeline Enhancements

### Gold Standard Scrubber

The `GoldStandardScrubber` (part of the `UniversalIngestor`) has been enhanced to process v23.5 artifacts.

*   **Deep Dive Tagging**: It automatically identifies and tags reports generated by the Deep Dive pipeline, ensuring they appear in the correct filters in the UI.
*   **Conviction Scoring**: The heuristic scoring algorithm now accounts for the depth of the v23.5 analysis, awarding higher conviction scores to reports that contain quantum simulation data.

### Universal Ingestor

*   **Code Documentation Parsing**: The ingestor now parses Python ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees) to extract docstrings and class structures from `core/` files. These are rendered as "Code Docs" in the Showcase, providing up-to-date technical documentation alongside financial reports.
