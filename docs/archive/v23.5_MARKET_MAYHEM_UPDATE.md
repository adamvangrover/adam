# Adam v23.5 - Market Mayhem Update (Dec 2025)

## Overview
This update transitions the Adam repository from "realistic mock" data to a "real-time" simulation context based on the **Market Mayhem Newsletter (December 12, 2025)**. The system now operates within the "Great Divergence" macro regime, reflecting specific future price levels, geopolitical events, and strategic mandates.

## Key Changes

### 1. Real-Time Data Injection
*   **Snapshot Generator:** `scripts/generate_market_snapshot.py` has been updated to generate market data consistent with the Dec 12, 2025 levels.
*   **Market Data:** `showcase/js/market_snapshot.js` now reflects the following key levels:
    *   S&P 500: ~6,827
    *   Dow Jones: ~48,458
    *   Bitcoin: ~$92,400
    *   Gold: ~$4,313
*   **New Tickers:** Added support for `CRML` (Critical Metals Corp), `VOLT` (Volta Motors), `AWAV` (AlphaWave), and others mentioned in the newsletter.

### 2. Training Data Update
*   **JSONL Update:** `data/market_mayhem_2025_update.jsonl` has been created. It contains Q&A pairs reflecting the specific insights, numbers, and narratives of the "Market Mayhem" newsletter (e.g., the "Fractured Ouroboros" risk, the 70/30 Fortress/Hunt mandate).

### 3. Report Generation
*   **New Report:** `core/libraries_and_archives/reports/market_mayhem_dec_2025.json` contains the full text of the newsletter as a structured artifact.
*   **Mock Data Integration:** `showcase/js/mock_data.js` has been regenerated to include this new report in the UI.

## Contextual Notes
*   **Macro Regime:** The system now assumes a "Bifurcated Market" where the "Soft Landing" narrative has failed for the bottom 80% of consumers (The Consumer Fracture).
*   **Strategic Mandate:** The recommended portfolio allocation is **70% Fortress** (Private Credit, Gold, Real Assets) and **30% Hunt** (Deep Tech, Distressed Credit).
*   **Geopolitics:** Energy prices are floored by "Operation Midnight Hammer" risks.

## Verification
*   **Symbol Correction:** Verified `CRML` is used for Critical Metals Corp (corrected from `CRIT`).
*   **Data Consistency:** Market snapshot prices align with the newsletter's "Market Snapshot" table.
