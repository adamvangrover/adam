# Future State Roadmap: The Adaptive Singularity Framework

## Overview
This document outlines the strategic roadmap for expanding the `core/future_state` module. The goal is to transform the current simulation engine into a comprehensive "Operating System for the Singularity," capable of tracking, predicting, and managing the transition to an AGI-dominated civilization.

## 1. Domain Expansions

### 1.1 Business Management & Logic
*   **AI-Native Corporations:** Model entities with no human employees, governed purely by smart contracts and utility functions.
*   **DAOs as Legal Persons:** Implement logic for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations to hold IP, sue, and be sued.
*   **Prediction Markets:** Integrate internal prediction markets for corporate strategy (Futarchy).

### 1.2 Economics (Thermodynamic & Behavioral)
*   **Entropy Accounting:** Expand `ThermodynamicSystem` to track "Negentropy Credits" as the reserve currency.
*   **Post-Labor Valuation:** Develop models for valuing "human attention" and "creative authenticity" in a world of synthetic abundance.
*   **Resource Based Economy (RBE):** Simulate the "Central Allocation Oracle" (Project Cybersyn 2.0) for distributing non-scarce goods without price signals.

### 1.3 Political Theory & Governance
*   **Algocracy vs. Democracy:** Simulate the tension between algorithmic efficiency and democratic legitimacy.
*   **The "Unverified" Class:** Model the socioeconomic impact on individuals who refuse or cannot obtain high-trust SSI credentials.
*   **Sovereign Cities:** Model the rise of Charter Cities (e.g., Prospera, Praxis) governed by corporate/AI law rather than nation-state law.

### 1.4 Philosophy & Alignment
*   **Consciousness Metrics:** Refine the `ConsciousnessMetric` using latest theories (IIT, Global Workspace).
*   **Suffering Calculus:** Implement modules to estimate "digital suffering" in simulations.
*   **Theological Alignment:** Model the divergence between "Transhumanist Integration" and "Bio-Essentialist Rejection" (Butlerian Jihad).

## 2. Technical Roadmap (DevOps / MLOps / ITOps)

### 2.1 MLOps: The Recursion Pipeline
*   **Self-Rewriting Code:** Implement safely sandboxed agents that can rewrite their own source code (`core/future_state/ops.py`).
*   **Automated Alignment Checks:** "Constitution as Code" – every code update is checked against `EthicalAlignment` constraints before deployment.
*   **Compute Arb:** Dynamic allocation of workloads across the `ComputeSubstrate` (Cloud vs. Edge vs. Decentralized).

### 2.2 DevOps: The Immutable Infrastructure
*   **Self-Healing Systems:** `ITOpsManager` should automatically deploy patches for zero-day vulnerabilities discovered by the AI.
*   **Air-Gapped Vaults:** Model "Cold Storage" for the core model weights to prevent unauthorized exfiltration or modification.

### 2.3 ITOps: The Planetary Computer
*   **Energy-Compute Nexus:** Direct integration with energy grid APIs to throttle training runs based on renewable availability.
*   **Hardware Agnosticism:** Seamless migration of active processes between Silicon, Photonic, and Quantum substrates.

## 3. Sign Posts & Monitoring
To validate the simulation against reality, we must track:
*   **Compute Costs:** Cost to train a GPT-4 equivalent (Signal: <$100k).
*   **Energy abundance:** Cost of Solar/Fusion (Signal: <$0.01/kWh).
*   **Legal Personhood:** First jurisdiction to grant AI full corporate personhood.
*   **Biological Integration:** First high-bandwidth bidirectional BCI (Neuralink > 1M bps).

## 4. Alignment & Safety
*   **The Kill Switch:** Maintain a "hardcoded" stop signal in `core/future_state/monitor.py` that halts simulation if `AlignmentScore` drops below critical threshold.
*   **Red Teaming:** Continuously run "Adversarial Future" scenarios to identify paths to dystopia (e.g., "Paperclip Maximizer").

## Conclusion
The `future_state` framework is not just a simulation; it is a dashboard for steering the future. By rigorously defining the variables of the Singularity, we move from passive observation to active architectural participation.
