# Automated Red Teaming

## Overview

Adam v22.0 uses automated red teaming to proactively discover and mitigate weaknesses in the system. This is achieved by having an AI agent, the `RedTeamAgent`, dedicated to challenging the system.

## The Red Team Agent

The `RedTeamAgent`'s mission is to generate novel and challenging scenarios that the system may not have been trained on. It can use techniques like GANs to create plausible but unexpected market conditions. It can also craft adversarial prompts to try to trick other agents into making mistakes.

## Red Teaming Framework

The `RedTeamingFramework` is used to run and evaluate red team exercises. The framework:

1.  Orchestrates the interaction between the `RedTeamAgent` and the rest of the system.
2.  Logs all interactions and outcomes.
3.  Generates a report that summarizes the system's performance and identifies any vulnerabilities that were discovered.

## Running a Red Team Exercise

To run a red team exercise, simply instantiate the `RedTeamingFramework` and call the `run` method.

## Interpreting the Results

The results of a red team exercise are summarized in a report. The report identifies any vulnerabilities that were discovered and provides recommendations for how to mitigate them.
