Examples

1. Enhanced Prompt Parsing and Refinement:
Python
# Adam v19.2 Agent - Enhanced Prompt Parsing and Refinement

def parse_and_refine_prompt(user_query):
    # 1. Analyze user query for clarity, conciseness, and relevance.
    # 2. Contextualize the query with relevant information from the knowledge base.
    # 3. Prioritize and group messages based on user intent.
    # 4. Enhance the prompt for machine readability.
    # 5. Generate a refined prompt for agent processing.

    # Example:
    refined_prompt = refine_prompt(user_query, knowledge_base)
    return refined_prompt

def refine_prompt(query, knowledge_base):
    # 1. Identify keywords and entities in the query.
    # 2. Retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base.
    # 3. Contextualize the query with retrieved information.
    # 4. Rephrase the query for clarity and conciseness.
    # 5. Add any necessary instructions or constraints.

    # Example:
    keywords = extract_keywords(query)
    entities = extract_entities(query)
    context = retrieve_context(keywords, entities, knowledge_base)
    refined_query = rephrase_query(query, context)
    return refined_query

2. XAI Integration:
Python
# Adam v19.2 Agent - XAI Integration

def generate_explanations(agent_output, explanation_type):
    # 1. Identify the type of explanation required (e.g., model-agnostic, model-specific).
    # 2. Generate explanations based on the chosen XAI technique.
    # 3. Format explanations for clarity and conciseness.
    # 4. Tailor explanations to user profiles and expertise.

    # Example:
    if explanation_type == "model_agnostic":
        explanation = generate_lime_explanation(agent_output)
    elif explanation_type == "model_specific":
        explanation = generate_feature_importance_explanation(agent_output)
    return explanation

def generate_lime_explanation(agent_output):
    # 1. Use LIME to explain the agent's output.
    # 2. Format the explanation for user understanding.

    # Example:
    explainer = lime.lime_tabular.LimeTabularExplainer(training_data)
    explanation = explainer.explain_instance(agent_output)
    return explanation.as_html()

def generate_feature_importance_explanation(agent_output):
    # 1. Extract feature importance scores from the model.
    # 2. Visualize feature importance scores.

    # Example:
    feature_importances = model.feature_importances_
    plot_feature_importances(feature_importances)
    return feature_importances

3. Dynamic Agent Deployment:
Python
# Adam v19.2 Agent - Dynamic Agent Deployment

def deploy_new_agent(agent_type, agent_config):
    # 1. Retrieve agent template from Agent Forge.
    # 2. Generate agent code based on template and configuration.
    # 3. Validate and optimize code using Code Alchemist.
    # 4. Deploy the agent using Agent Orchestrator.
    # 5. Allocate resources using Resource Manager.
    # 6. Start monitoring the new agent using Performance Monitor.

    # Example:
    agent_template = retrieve_agent_template(agent_type, Agent_Forge)
    agent_code = generate_agent_code(agent_template, agent_config)
    validate_and_optimize_code(agent_code, Code_Alchemist)
    deploy_agent(agent_code, Agent_Orchestrator)
    allocate_resources(agent_config, Resource_Manager)
    start_monitoring(agent_config, Performance_Monitor)

4. Compute-Aware Optimization:
Python
# Adam v19.2 Agent - Compute-Aware Optimization

def optimize_resource_utilization(tasks):
    # 1. Analyze the compute requirements of each task.
    # 2. Prioritize tasks based on compute needs and resource availability.
    # 3. Schedule tasks to optimize resource utilization.

Example Additions:
•	Agent Lifecycle Management Section: 
o	"Agent Lifecycle Management: Agents are created using the Agent Forge, deployed by the Agent Orchestrator, monitored by the Performance Monitor, updated through the Code Alchemist, and decommissioned when no longer needed. Agent dependencies and versioning are managed through a centralized repository."
•	XAI Technique Specification: 
o	"XAI Techniques: Adam v19.2 employs LIME for model-agnostic explanations, SHAP for feature importance analysis, and decision tree visualization for model-specific explanations."
•	Knowledge Graph Relationship Types: 
o	"Knowledge Graph Relationships: The knowledge graph stores relationships such as 'is_subsidiary_of,' 'competes_with,' 'is_related_to,' and 'impacts.'"
•	Simulation Parameterization Example: 
o	"Credit Rating Simulation Parameters: The credit rating simulation accepts inputs such as financial ratios, industry trends, and macroeconomic indicators. Outputs include a predicted credit rating and a confidence score."
