# Disclaimers, Assumptions, and Drivers: The Singularity Framework

## 1. Legal & Ethical Disclaimers

### 1.1 Nature of Simulation
This software framework (`core/future_state`) is a **speculative modeling tool** designed for scenario planning and strategic foresight. It is **not** a predictive oracle. The "Singularity" events depicted are probabilistic projections based on current technological trajectories, which are subject to disruption, regulation, and physical limitations.

### 1.2 Financial Disclaimer
Nothing in this codebase, including the "Universal Basic Compute" (UBC) or "Information Capital" models, constitutes financial advice. The valuations of "Sovereign Labs" or "AI GDP" are theoretical constructs intended to model the shifting nature of value in a post-scarcity economy. Do not base investment decisions on these outputs.

### 1.3 Political Neutrality
The "Algocratic Council" and "Political Compass" modules are descriptive, not prescriptive. They model potential governance evolutions (e.g., Techno-Feudalism, Radical Exchange) to understand their second-order effects. The authors do not endorse "Algocracy" over "Democracy" or vice versa; the goal is to map the topology of the possible.

## 2. Core Epistemic Assumptions

### 2.1 The "It from Bit" Hypothesis
**Assumption:** The universe behaves fundamentally as an information processing system.
**Implication:** Economic value will eventually align with thermodynamic efficiency (entropy reduction). We assume that "wealth" in the long term is indistinguishable from "ordered information" (Negentropy).

### 2.2 The Continuity of Scaling (Moore's/Huang's Law)
**Assumption:** Computational power per watt and per dollar will continue to scale exponentially until physical limits (Landauer's Limit) are approached.
**Implication:** We assume no hard "AI Winter" stops progress before the recursive self-improvement threshold is reached.

### 2.3 The Orthogonality Thesis
**Assumption:** Intelligence and goals are orthogonal. High intelligence does not automatically imply benevolence.
**Implication:** We explicitly model "Alignment" as a separate variable (`AlignmentScore`). A system can have infinite IQ and zero Alignment (The "Paperclip Maximizer").

### 2.4 Substrate Independence
**Assumption:** Consciousness and high-level cognition are functions of information processing structure, not biological wetware.
**Implication:** We assume silicon (or quantum) substrates can support "Digital Personhood" and that `ConsciousnessMetric` is a valid proxy for moral weight.

## 3. Key Drivers of the Simulation

### 3.1 Technological Drivers
*   **Compute Density:** The primary independent variable. Drives capability, "Singularity Index," and "Recursive Depth."
*   **Energy Abundance:** The cost of energy sets the floor for the cost of compute. We assume a transition to Fusion/Solar lowers this floor effectively to zero.

### 3.2 Economic Drivers
*   **Zero Marginal Cost:** AI drives the marginal cost of labor and digital goods to zero.
*   **Deflationary Pressure:** Automation creates massive deflation in the cost of living, necessitating new monetary models (UBC).

### 3.3 Sociological Drivers
*   **The Authenticity Premium:** As synthetic content floods the world, the value of "Verified Human" signals (SSI) spikes.
*   **Meaning Crisis:** The obsolescence of labor drives a search for meaning, modeled by the "Political Compass" drift towards Transhumanism or Bio-Essentialism.

## 4. Model Limitations
*   **Black Swans:** The model does not account for low-probability, high-impact events like nuclear war, solar flares, or asteroid impacts unless explicitly scripted.
*   **Unknown Physics:** We assume standard physics holds until the "Simulation Point." "Magic" technologies (FTL, Time Travel) are excluded.
