# Adam v17.0 User Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions on how to use Adam v17.0, the advanced financial analytics system. It covers various aspects, including:

* Accessing and utilizing the knowledge graph
* Interacting with the API
* Running different analysis modules
* Interpreting results and generating reports
* Customizing strategies and settings

## Knowledge Graph

Adam v17.0's knowledge graph is a rich repository of financial concepts, models, and data, organized in a structured and interconnected manner. It enables Adam to perform in-depth analysis, provide context-aware insights, and generate actionable recommendations.

### Accessing the Knowledge Graph

You can access the knowledge graph through the following methods:

* **API:** The Adam v17.0 API provides endpoints for retrieving and updating information in the knowledge graph. See the API section for more details and examples.
* **Direct Access:** You can also directly access the knowledge graph data stored in the `data/knowledge_graph.json` file. This file is structured in JSON format and can be easily parsed and queried using various tools and libraries. Here's an example of how to access the knowledge graph data using Python:

```python
import json

with open('data/knowledge_graph.json', 'r') as f:
    knowledge_graph = json.load(f)

# Access the nodes and edges
nodes = knowledge_graph['Valuation']['DCF']['machine_readable']['nodes']
edges = knowledge_graph['Valuation']['DCF']['machine_readable']['edges']

# Print the nodes and edges
print(nodes)
print(edges)
````

### Utilizing the Knowledge Graph

The knowledge graph can be used for various purposes, including:

  * **Understanding Financial Concepts:** Explore the definitions, explanations, and relationships between different financial concepts. Each node in the knowledge graph represents a concept, and the edges represent the relationships between them. For example, you can explore the concept of "Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)" and its relationship to other concepts like "Free Cash Flow" and "Discount Rate."
  * **Conducting Research:** Use the knowledge graph to research specific topics or areas of interest. You can traverse the graph to find related concepts and explore their connections. For example, you can start with the concept of "Market Risk" and traverse the graph to explore different types of market risks, such as "Interest Rate Risk" and "Equity Price Risk."
  * **Validating Information:** Verify the accuracy and consistency of financial data and models. The knowledge graph provides a structured representation of financial knowledge that can be used for validation purposes. For example, you can check if the formula for calculating "Debt-to-Equity Ratio" is consistent with the definition in the knowledge graph.
  * **Developing New Agents and Modules:** Leverage the knowledge graph to develop new agents and modules that can enhance Adam's capabilities. The knowledge graph can serve as a foundation for building new AI components that can reason about financial information. For example, you can use the knowledge graph to develop an agent that specializes in analyzing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors.

## API

The Adam v17.0 API provides a unified interface for interacting with the system. It allows you to access various functionalities, including:

  * **Retrieving Data:** Get data from the knowledge graph, market data feeds, and other sources.
  * **Running Analysis Modules:** Execute different analysis modules, such as market sentiment analysis, fundamental analysis, and technical analysis.
  * **Generating Reports:** Create customized reports based on the analysis results.
  * **Managing Agents:** Control the behavior and interactions of different agents within the system.

### API Documentation

Detailed API documentation is available in the `docs/api_docs.yaml` file. It outlines the available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats. You can use tools like Swagger UI to visualize and interact with the API documentation.

### API Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use the API:

  * **Get the DCF valuation for AAPL:**

    ```bash
    curl -X POST /api/v1 \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"module": "valuation", "action": "get_dcf_valuation", "parameters": {"company": "AAPL", "forecast_period": 5}}'
    ```

  * **Get the latest market sentiment for the technology sector:**

    ```bash
    curl -X POST /api/v1 \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"module": "market_sentiment", "action": "get_sentiment", "parameters": {"sector": "technology"}}'
    ```

  * **Update the risk-free rate in the knowledge graph:**

    ```bash
    curl -X POST /api/v1 \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"module": "knowledge_graph", "action": "update_node", "parameters": {"node_id": "risk_free_rate", "new_value": 0.02}}'
    ```

## Analysis Modules

Adam v17.0 provides various analysis modules that can be used to gain insights into financial markets and make informed investment decisions. These modules include:

  * **Market Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes news articles, social media, and financial forums to gauge investor sentiment towards different assets and markets.
  * **Macroeconomic Analysis:** Monitors and interprets key economic indicators (e.g., GDP, inflation, interest rates) to assess the macroeconomic environment and its potential impact on investments.
  * **Geopolitical Risk Analysis:** Identifies and analyzes geopolitical risks (e.g., political instability, trade wars) and their potential impact on financial markets.
  * **Fundamental Analysis:** Performs in-depth fundamental analysis of companies, including financial statement analysis, valuation modeling, and risk assessment.
  * **Technical Analysis:** Analyzes price charts, technical indicators, and patterns to identify trading opportunities and generate trading signals.

### Running Analysis Modules

You can run analysis modules through the API or by directly calling the corresponding Python scripts in the `core/modules` directory.

**Example using API:**

```bash
curl -X POST /api/v1 \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"module": "fundamental_analysis", "action": "analyze_company", "parameters": {"company": "MSFT"}}'
```

**Example using Python script:**

```bash
python core/modules/fundamental_analysis.py --company MSFT
```

### Interpreting Results

The results of the analysis modules are typically presented in a structured format, such as JSON or CSV. You can then use these results to generate reports, create visualizations, or develop custom trading strategies.

**Example:**

The `fundamental_analysis.py` script might output a JSON file containing the following information:

```json
{
  "company": "MSFT",
  "revenue": 168088000000,
  "net_income": 61271000000,
  "eps": 8.04,
  "pe_ratio": 35.5,
  "debt_to_equity": 0.45,
  //... other financial metrics
}
```

You can then use this data to generate a report or create a visualization of MSFT's financial performance.

## Customizing Strategies and Settings

Adam v17.0 allows you to customize various aspects of the system, including:

  * **Investment Strategies:** Define your own investment strategies based on Adam's insights and your risk tolerance and investment goals. You can use the API or configuration files to specify your investment preferences and constraints.
  * **Agent Behavior:** Configure the behavior and interactions of different agents within the system. You can adjust the parameters of each agent to fine-tune their analysis and decision-making processes.
  * **Data Sources:** Add or remove data sources to customize the information that Adam uses for its analysis. You can connect to different financial data providers, databases, or APIs to enrich Adam's knowledge base.
  * **Alerting:** Set up alerts to be notified of specific events or market conditions. You can define custom alert rules based on various factors, such as price movements, news events, or sentiment changes.
