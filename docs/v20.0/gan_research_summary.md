# Research Summary: Generative Models for Synthetic Financial Time-Series Data

## 1. Objective

This research summary addresses a key deliverable for the **Generative Simulation** theme of the Adam v20.0 roadmap. The goal is to research the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or other generative models for creating realistic, synthetic financial time-series data. This capability is foundational to developing a "Generative Simulation" engine that can create novel market scenarios, including "black swan" events, for training and stress-testing Adam's analytical agents.

## 2. Lead Agent

*   **Machine Learning Model Training Agent:** Responsible for research, proof-of-concept development, and eventual implementation of the generative models.

## 3. Generative Model Landscape

While several generative models exist (e.g., Variational Autoencoders), **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** have shown particular promise for generating realistic time-series data.

A GAN consists of two neural networks:
*   **The Generator:** Attempts to create synthetic data that mimics the real data distribution. In our case, it would generate a sequence of synthetic stock prices.
*   **The Discriminator:** Attempts to distinguish between real data (from historical market data) and fake data (from the Generator).

The two networks are trained in a zero-sum game: the Generator gets better at fooling the Discriminator, and the Discriminator gets better at catching the fakes. Over time, the Generator learns to produce highly realistic synthetic data.

## 4. Specific GAN Architectures for Time-Series Data

Standard GANs are not well-suited for sequential data like time-series. Several specialized architectures have been developed:

*   **Recurrent GANs (RGANs):** Both the Generator and Discriminator use Recurrent Neural Networks (e.g., LSTMs or GRUs) to capture the temporal dependencies in the data. This is a natural fit for stock prices, which are highly dependent on their own past values.
*   **Time-series GAN (TimeGAN):** A more recent and highly promising framework specifically designed for realistic time-series generation. It incorporates an autoencoder to learn the data's temporal correlations in a lower-dimensional latent space, making the GAN's job easier and more effective.
*   **Conditional GANs (cGANs):** This architecture allows for generating data conditioned on certain inputs. For our purposes, we could condition the GAN on macroeconomic variables (e.g., interest rates, inflation) to generate market data that reflects specific economic regimes. This is a powerful tool for scenario analysis.

## 5. Proof-of-Concept Model

A proof-of-concept (PoC) model will be developed to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.

*   **Objective:** Generate synthetic daily stock price data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) for a single, well-known security (e.g., AAPL).
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Data:** Use historical daily price data from a public source (e.g., Yahoo Finance).
    2.  **Preprocessing:** Normalize the data and create sequences of a fixed length (e.g., 30 days) to be used as input for the models.
    3.  **Architecture:** Implement a simple RGAN using TensorFlow or PyTorch. The Generator will take random noise as input and output a 30-day price sequence. The Discriminator will take a 30-day sequence (real or fake) and output a probability of it being real.
    4.  **Training:** Train the network for a set number of epochs.
    5.  **Evaluation:** The primary evaluation will be qualitative. We will plot the generated time-series and visually inspect them for realistic-looking patterns, volatility, and trends. Quantitative evaluation is notoriously difficult but could involve comparing the statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation) of the real and synthetic data.

## 6. Recommendation

The research strongly supports the feasibility of using GANs to generate synthetic financial data. The **TimeGAN** architecture appears to be the state-of-the-art and should be the target for a production-level implementation.

For the initial PoC, a simpler **RGAN** is sufficient to prove the concept and build foundational code. This PoC will serve as the first deliverable for the Generative Simulation engine and will pave the way for more complex, conditional models capable of simulating the "black swan" scenarios defined in the project roadmap.
