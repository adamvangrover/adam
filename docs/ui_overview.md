# ADAM UI Overview

This document provides an overview of the ADAM web application's user interface, its components, and how they connect to the backend agent architecture.

## High-Level Architecture

The ADAM UI can be run as a web app, a single page, command line, or built from portable, standalone components. It is designed to be a rich and interactive interface for financial analysis, providing a user-friendly way to interact with the powerful backend agents.

## Key UI Components

The UI is organized into several key components, each corresponding to a major feature of the ADAM system:

*   **Dashboard:** The main landing page, providing a high-level overview of market data, portfolio performance, investment ideas, and alerts.
*   **Market Data:** A dedicated section for exploring detailed market data, including charts, tables, and news feeds.
*   **Analysis Tools:** A suite of tools for performing fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and risk assessment.
*   **Portfolio Management:** A section for managing investment portfolios, including viewing holdings, editing portfolios, and tracking performance.
*   **Alerts:** A customizable alerting system for notifying users of important market events or changes in their portfolio.
*   **News and Insights:** A curated feed of financial news and insights generated by the ADAM agents.
*   **Navigator:** A file explorer for browsing the ADAM repository.
*   **Chatbot:** A conversational interface for interacting with the ADAM agents.

## Connection to Agent Backend

The ADAM UI is designed to be a frontend for the powerful backend agent architecture. The UI components will eventually be connected to the Orchestrator Agent, which will delegate tasks to the appropriate Sub-Agents and Meta-Agents.

For example:

*   The **Market Data** component will request data from a Sub-Agent that is responsible for fetching data from a financial API.
*   The **Analysis Tools** will send analysis requests to a Meta-Agent that is responsible for performing the analysis.
*   The **Chatbot** will send user queries to the Orchestrator Agent, which will then coordinate a response from the appropriate agents.

This separation of concerns allows for a modular and extensible system, where new UI components and backend agents can be added independently.
