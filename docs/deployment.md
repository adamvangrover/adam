# Adam v15.4 Deployment Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide for deploying Adam v15.4 in various environments.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying Adam v15.4, ensure you have the following:

* **Hardware:** A server or virtual machine with sufficient resources (CPU, memory, storage) to handle the workload. The specific requirements will depend on the scale of your deployment and the expected usage.
* **Operating System:** Adam v15.4 can be deployed on various operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. Choose an OS that meets your needs and preferences.
* **Python:** Adam v15.4 is written in Python, so you'll need to have a compatible version of Python installed on your system. Refer to the `requirements.txt` file for specific version requirements.
* **Dependencies:** Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* **Data Sources:** Ensure you have access to the necessary data sources (e.g., financial news APIs, market data providers) and have set the required API keys as environment variables (e.g., `BEA_API_KEY`, `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`).
* **Configuration:** Review and modify the modular configuration files in the `config/` directory, such as `agents.yaml`, `system.yaml`, `settings.yaml`, `data_sources.yaml`, to customize settings, data sources, and other parameters. The main `config/config.yaml` is deprecated for direct editing.

## Deployment Options

Adam v15.4 can be deployed in various ways:

* **Direct Deployment:** Install the code directly on the server and run the scripts from the command line. This is suitable for simple deployments and development environments.
* **Virtual Environment:** Create a virtual environment to isolate the Adam v15.4 dependencies from other projects on your system. This is recommended for better dependency management and portability.
* **Docker Container:** Package Adam v15.4 into a Docker container for easier deployment, portability, and scalability. This allows you to deploy the application on any system with Docker installed.
* **Cloud Platforms:** Deploy Adam v15.4 on cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. These platforms offer various services and tools for deployment, scaling, and management.

## Deployment Steps

### Direct Deployment

1. **Prepare the Server:**
    * Install Python and pip.
    * Clone the Adam v15.4 repository from GitHub.
    * Navigate to the repository's root directory.
2. **Install Dependencies:**
    * Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages.
3. **Configure Settings:**
    * Modify the relevant modular configuration files in the `config/` directory (e.g., `config/settings.yaml`, `config/data_sources.yaml`, `config/agents.yaml`) to set parameters, data sources, and other preferences. The main `config/config.yaml` file is no longer directly edited for these settings.
4. **Run Adam v15.4:**
    * Execute the desired scripts from the `scripts` directory. For example, to generate a newsletter, run `python scripts/generate_newsletter.py`.

### Virtual Environment Deployment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    * Run `python -m venv.venv` to create a virtual environment named `.venv`.
2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    * On Linux/macOS: `source.venv/bin/activate`
    * On Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
3. **Install Dependencies:**
    * Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages within the virtual environment.
4. **Configure and Run:**
    * Follow steps 3 and 4 from the Direct Deployment instructions.

### Docker Deployment

1. **Create a Dockerfile:**
    ```dockerfile
    FROM python:3.9

    WORKDIR /app

    COPY requirements.txt.
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    COPY..

    CMD ["python", "scripts/run_adam.py"]
    ```
2. **Build the Docker Image:**
    * Run `docker build -t adam-v15.4.` to build the image.
3. **Run the Docker Container:**
    * Run `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 adam-v15.4` to start a container and expose port 8080.
    * Access Adam v15.4 through the exposed port.

### Cloud Platform Deployment (AWS Example)

1. **Create an EC2 Instance:**
    * Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with Python pre-installed.
    * Configure the instance type and security groups as needed.
2. **Connect to the Instance:**
    * Use SSH to connect to the EC2 instance.
3. **Install Dependencies and Configure:**
    * Follow steps 2 and 3 from the Direct Deployment instructions.
4. **Run Adam v15.4:**
    * Use a process manager (e.g., systemd, supervisor) to run the Adam v15.4 scripts as background processes.

## Scaling and Monitoring

* **Scaling:** To scale Adam v15.4, you can increase the resources of your server, deploy multiple instances of the application, or use cloud-based scaling solutions.
* **Monitoring:** Monitor the performance and health of your Adam v15.4 deployment using logging, monitoring tools, and system metrics.

## Security Considerations

* **API Keys:** API keys are now managed via environment variables. This is a security best practice as it helps prevent keys from being accidentally committed to version control. Ensure your deployment environment securely provides these environment variables to the Adam application.
* **Data Protection:** Implement appropriate security measures to protect sensitive data, such as encryption and access controls.
* **Regular Updates:** Keep Adam v15.4 and its dependencies up-to-date to address security vulnerabilities.
