# Shared National Credit (SNC) Exam Preparation Guide for Bank Analysts

## 1. Introduction to SNC Exams

### Purpose
The Shared National Credit (SNC) Program is a review of large syndicated loans and loan commitments ($100 million or more that are shared by three or more federally supervised institutions). Its primary purpose is to provide a consistent and uniform classification of large syndicated credits across regulatory agencies (OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC). The exam aims to:
*   Assess the credit quality and risk management practices associated with these large exposures.
*   Identify trends in syndicated lending.
*   Ensure banks have adequate capital and reserves for these exposures.
*   Promote sound underwriting and credit administration practices.

### Scope
*   **Loan Size:** Generally, credits aggregating $100 million or more.
*   **Participants:** Shared by three or more federally supervised institutions.
*   **Focus:** While the agent bank often has primary interaction, all participating banks' exposure and risk management are implicitly under review. Examiners assess the overall credit, and the assigned rating applies to all banks in the syndicate.

### Importance for Your Institution
*   **Regulatory Scrutiny:** SNC ratings directly impact your institution's regulatory assessment, CAMELS ratings (or equivalent), and capital adequacy considerations.
*   **Provisioning & Capital:** Criticized assets (Substandard, Doubtful, Loss) typically require higher specific reserves or allocations of capital, impacting profitability and capital ratios.
*   **Reputational Risk:** Consistently poor SNC results can damage an institution's reputation with regulators and the market.
*   **Risk Management Improvement:** Exam findings provide valuable feedback for strengthening underwriting, credit administration, and monitoring processes.

## 2. Pre-Exam Preparation: Documentation is Key

Thorough, accurate, and well-organized documentation is the cornerstone of a successful SNC exam. Examiners will form initial impressions based on the quality of your credit files long before they speak with an analyst.

### 2.1. Essential Credit File Components
Ensure each credit file for an SNC loan is comprehensive and current. Key components include:

*   **Credit Approval Document (Write-up/Credit Memo):**
    *   **Original Approval:** The detailed write-up supporting the initial credit decision. This should clearly articulate the transaction, borrower, industry, financial analysis, risk assessment, and mitigants.
    *   **Amendments & Waivers:** All subsequent approvals for amendments, waivers, or material changes to the credit facility, with clear justification.
    *   **Annual Reviews/Renewals:** Timely and thorough periodic reviews reaffirming the creditworthiness or detailing any changes.
*   **Borrower Information:**
    *   Full legal name, address, legal structure.
    *   Organizational chart, including parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates.
    *   Ownership structure, including key principals or private equity sponsors.
*   **Loan Documentation:**
    *   Signed Credit Agreement and all annexes/schedules.
    *   Security agreements, mortgages, pledge agreements.
    *   Guarantees (if any).
    *   Notes, term sheets, commitment letters.
*   **Financial Statements & Analysis:**
    *   **Historical Financials:** Typically 3-5 years of audited (if available) annual statements (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow, Statement of Retained Earnings, Footnotes).
    *   **Interim Financials:** Quarterly statements, including compliance certificates.
    *   **Financial Spreads:** Standardized spreads of historical and interim financials in a consistent format. Clearly define any adjustments made (e.g., for non-recurring items – ensure these are well-justified and consistently applied).
    *   **Projections/Forecasts:** Borrower-prepared and/or bank-sensitized financial projections, including key assumptions. These are critical for assessing repayment capacity.
    *   **Ratio Analysis:** Key leverage, liquidity, profitability, efficiency, and coverage ratios, with trends and comparisons to peers/industry if possible.
*   **Collateral Information (If Secured):**
    *   Detailed description of collateral.
    *   Current valuations (appraisals for real estate, field exams for ABL, market quotes for securities). Frequency of updates should align with policy and risk.
    *   Lien perfection documentation (e.g., UCC searches, mortgage filings).
    *   Loan-to-Value (LTV) calculations, regularly updated.
*   **Industry & Market Analysis:**
    *   Description of the borrower’s industry, market position, and competitive landscape.
    *   Key industry risks and outlook.
*   **Ongoing Monitoring Documentation:**
    *   Call reports summarizing discussions with the borrower.
    *   Internal risk rating history and rationale for any changes.
    *   Covenant compliance tracking, including calculations and any breaches/waivers.
    *   News articles, market updates relevant to the borrower or industry.
    *   Watchlist reports or problem loan reports if applicable.
*   **Communication Records:**
    *   Key correspondence with the borrower, agent bank (if a participant), and other syndicate members.

### 2.2. Financial Analysis & Spreading Standards
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure financial data is accurately transcribed into spreading software. Reconcile spreads to source documents.
*   **Consistency:** Apply accounting treatments and adjustments consistently across periods and, where possible, across borrowers in similar industries.
*   **Adjustments:** Clearly document and justify all non-GAAP adjustments (e.g., EBITDA add-backs for synergies, non-recurring items). Be prepared to defend these, as examiners often scrutinize them.
*   **Projections:** Base projections on well-supported assumptions. Stress test key assumptions (e.g., revenue growth, margins, interest rates) to understand downside risks.

### 2.3. Ongoing Monitoring & Early Warning Systems
Demonstrate proactive credit management:
*   **Regular Reviews:** Evidence of timely annual (or more frequent, if warranted) reviews.
*   **Covenant Monitoring:** Robust tracking of financial covenants with clear calculations. Document any breaches immediately and the actions taken (waiver, reservation of rights, etc.).
*   **Early Warning Indicators (EWIs):** Show that the bank has a system to identify deteriorating credit quality (e.g., declining financial trends, covenant pressure, adverse industry news, management changes) and that EWIs trigger enhanced monitoring or action.
*   **Watchlist Process:** If a credit is on a watchlist, ensure reports are current, action plans are documented, and progress is tracked.

### 2.4. Internal Rating Process & Justification
*   **Clear Rationale:** The basis for the current internal risk rating must be clearly articulated in the latest review or credit memo. It should link directly to the bank’s risk rating methodology and definitions.
*   **Timeliness:** Risk rating changes (upgrades or downgrades) should be made promptly when conditions change, not just at annual review time.
*   **Objectivity:** While relationship considerations exist, ratings must be grounded in an objective assessment of credit risk based on facts and analysis.

**Pro-Tip for Documentation:** Create a “Pre-Exam Checklist” for your key SNC files. Review them against this checklist well before the exam to identify and remediate any gaps. Assume examiners will look at everything. If a document is missing or analysis is weak, it's better to identify and fix it proactively.

## 3. Understanding and Applying SNC Guidelines

A deep understanding of the SNC definitions and how regulators interpret them is crucial. Your internal ratings should align with these principles, especially for credits at or near the criticized categories.

### 3.1. Key SNC Definitions (Summarized)
*(Refer to the latest official interagency SNC guidelines for precise definitions. The `risk_rating_mapping_v2.json` in this repo also contains useful indicative criteria.)*

*   **Pass:** Credits of sound quality. Repayment from reliable sources is expected as agreed. Minimal risk identified. Assets are adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor and/or by any pledged collateral.
*   **Special Mention (SM):** Credits that have *potential weaknesses* that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution's credit position at some future date. These are not yet adversely classified but possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management's close attention.
*   **Substandard:** Credits that are *inadequately protected* by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a *well-defined weakness or weaknesses* that jeopardize the orderly liquidation of the debt. There is a distinct possibility that the institution will sustain *some loss* if the deficiencies are not corrected.
*   **Doubtful:** Credits that have all the weaknesses inherent in one classified Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make *collection or liquidation in full*, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, *highly questionable and improbable*.
*   **Loss:** Credits that are considered *uncollectible and of such little value* that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be effected in the future.

### 3.2. Core Focus Areas for Examiners
Examiners will typically scrutinize these aspects of each credit:

*   **Repayment Capacity (Primary Source of Repayment):**
    *   **Historical Performance:** Consistent earnings (EBITDA, Net Income) and cash flow (Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow) sufficient to cover debt service (principal and interest).
    *   **Projected Performance:** Realistic and well-supported projections. Scrutinize assumptions for revenue growth, margins, and cost controls. Stress tests are important.
    *   **Sustainability:** Is repayment capacity sustainable through economic cycles or industry-specific challenges? Reliance on one-time events or asset sales for regular debt service is a red flag.
    *   **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) / Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (FCCR) / Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR):** Trends and levels against industry norms and loan covenants.
*   **Collateral (Secondary Source of Repayment):**
    *   **Valuation:** Current, independent appraisals/valuations. Examiners will question stale or overly optimistic valuations.
    *   **Lien Perfection:** Proper legal documentation and perfected liens.
    *   **Liquidity/Marketability:** How easily can the collateral be converted to cash? What are the costs of liquidation?
    *   **Loan-to-Value (LTV):** Current LTVs and how they compare to policy and original underwriting. Is there sufficient collateral cushion?
*   **Capital Structure & Leverage:**
    *   **Debt-to-Equity / Debt-to-Total Capital:** Is the borrower overly leveraged? How does this compare to peers?
    *   **Tangible Net Worth:** Quality of equity; reliance on intangible assets.
    *   **Debt Composition:** Mix of senior/subordinated debt, secured/unsecured. Maturity profile – any large near-term maturities?
*   **Liquidity:**
    *   **Working Capital:** Ability to meet short-term obligations (Current Ratio, Quick Ratio).
    *   **Cash on Hand / Access to Facilities:** Sufficient liquidity to weather short-term disruptions or seasonality.
    *   **Contingency Funding Plan:** Especially for companies reliant on capital markets.
*   **Management & Sponsorship:**
    *   **Experience & Track Record:** Management's capability and history, especially in challenging times or with complex integrations.
    *   **Sponsor Support (for PE-backed deals):** Willingness and ability of the sponsor to provide financial support (equity injections, etc.). This is often viewed skeptically by examiners as a primary mitigant unless legally committed.
    *   **Governance:** Any concerns with corporate governance or strategic direction.
*   **Covenant Compliance:**
    *   Strict tracking and reporting. Breaches, waivers, and amendments will be closely examined. Frequent waivers can signal underlying credit weakness.

### 3.3. Interpreting Key Phrases
*   **"Well-Defined Weakness(es)":** This is key for Substandard. It's not just a minor concern. It must be a specific, identifiable issue (e.g., sustained negative FCF, ICR below 1.0x, significant collateral shortfall, prolonged covenant breach without remedy) that clearly jeopardizes the ability to collect the debt in an orderly fashion.
*   **"Orderly Repayment":** Implies repayment according to the contractual terms from recurring, reliable sources (usually operating cash flow). Reliance on refinancing in a difficult market, asset sales not part of an ongoing strategy, or continuous equity cures is not "orderly."
*   **"Adequately Protected":** This relates to both the borrower's ability to generate cash flow for repayment and the value/availability of collateral. If the primary source is weak, the secondary source (collateral) must be strong and readily available.

## 4. Internal Reporting and SNC Data Submission

### 4.1. Accuracy and Completeness of Data Tapes
*   The data tapes (loan trial balances, portfolio characteristic summaries) submitted to the regulators before the exam are critical. Errors or inconsistencies here create a poor first impression and can lead to deeper dives.
*   **Key Data Points to Verify:** Ensure accuracy of obligor names, facility amounts, commitment amounts, outstandings, internal risk ratings, accrual status, collateral codes, industry codes, origination dates, maturity dates, etc.
*   **Reconciliation:** Reconcile data tape totals to internal general ledger and portfolio reporting systems.

### 4.2. Internal Pre-Review / Mock Exams
*   Conducting an internal “mock SNC exam” or a rigorous pre-review of credits likely to be in the SNC scope can be invaluable.
*   **Identify Potential Criticisms:** Have experienced credit officers or a dedicated credit review function assess loans against SNC criteria *before* the regulators do.
*   **Strengthen Files:** Use this process to identify documentation gaps, weak analyses, or poorly justified ratings and remediate them proactively.
*   **Prepare Analysts:** This helps relationship managers and portfolio managers practice defending their credits and articulating risk assessments.

## 5. The SNC Exam Process: On-Site and Off-Site Components

SNC exams typically have phases, which may be a mix of off-site analysis by examiners and on-site discussions.

### 5.1. Initial Information Requests (IIRs)
*   Expect detailed requests for loan files, portfolio data, policies, procedures, and other relevant information well in advance of the on-site portion.
*   Respond accurately, completely, and by the deadline. Organize submissions clearly.

### 5.2. Examiner Interactions: Interviews and Q&A
*   **Lead Analyst/Officer:** Be prepared to discuss each credit you manage that is in the SNC scope.
*   **Agent Bank Meetings:** For agented deals, the agent bank typically leads discussions, but participants may also be involved.
*   **Focus:** Examiners will ask clarifying questions about the data, your analysis, risk mitigants, and any changes since the last review.
*   **Professionalism:** Maintain a professional, cooperative, and transparent demeanor.

### 5.3. Preliminary Findings and Discussions
*   Examiners will often share preliminary lists of credits they have concerns about or are considering for adverse classification.
*   This is a critical opportunity to provide additional information, clarify misunderstandings, or present counterarguments *before* final decisions are made.
*   Engage constructively. Understand their concerns fully before responding.


## 6. Defending Your Ratings: Building a Cohesive Narrative

When an examiner questions a rating or proposes an adverse classification, your ability to articulate a clear, fact-based, and cohesive narrative is paramount.

### 6.1. Anticipating Examiner Questions
For each SNC credit, especially those with any complexity or recent stress:
*   Review it as if you were an examiner. What would jump out?
*   What are the weakest points? What are the strongest mitigants?
*   Are there any apparent contradictions in the file (e.g., positive narrative but declining financials)?
*   Why is your internal rating appropriate based on SNC definitions?

### 6.2. Structuring Your Defense
When discussing a credit, have a clear structure in mind:
*   **Acknowledge and Validate (if appropriate):** If the examiner raises a valid point (e.g., declining revenue), acknowledge it. Don't be defensive from the outset.
*   **State Your Rating and Overall Thesis:** Clearly state your institution's current internal rating and your overall assessment (e.g., "We have this rated Pass. While we acknowledge the recent dip in margins, we believe repayment capacity remains strong due to...").
*   **Present Key Facts & Analysis:** Walk through the key risk areas (Repayment, Collateral, Leverage, Liquidity, Management, Covenants) with specific, current data.
    *   Focus on trends, not just point-in-time data.
    *   Highlight positive factors and strengths.
*   **Address Weaknesses Proactively:** Discuss known weaknesses and, crucially, what mitigants are in place or what actions are being taken.
    *   Is there a credible company plan to address the issue?
    *   What is the bank's action plan (e.g., increased monitoring, discussions with management, covenant waivers with specific conditions)?
*   **Collateral Reliance (if applicable):** If the primary source of repayment is weak and you're relying on collateral, be prepared for deep scrutiny on valuation, LTV, and liquidation prospects.
*   **Sponsor Support (if applicable):** Be cautious about over-relying on potential sponsor support unless it's a firm, legally binding commitment. Examiners are often skeptical of implied support.

### 6.3. Specific and Timely Justifications for Ratings
*   **Pass Ratings:** Don't assume a 'Pass' needs no defense. Be able to articulate *why* it's a Pass. What are the strengths? How are risks managed? This is especially true for credits near the Pass/Special Mention borderline.
*   **Special Mention:** Clearly define the *potential* weakness. What is being monitored? What are the triggers for further action or downgrade?
*   **Adversely Classified Credits (if you agree with a Substandard or worse internal rating):** Your defense here is about the *appropriateness* of the rating level and the adequacy of your action plan (e.g., reserves, workout strategy).
*   **Timeliness:** Your justification must be based on the *current* situation and information available up to the exam cut-off date. Outdated analysis is a major red flag.

### 6.4. Addressing Criticized Assets: Action Plans and Follow-up
If a loan is criticized (either internally or by examiners):
*   **Action Plan:** Have a clear, documented action plan. This should include:
    *   Steps to mitigate risk.
    *   Responsible parties.
    *   Timelines.
    *   Expected outcomes.
*   **Monitoring:** Detail the enhanced monitoring procedures for criticized assets.
*   **Reporting:** Ensure internal reporting reflects the criticized status and action plan progress.

### 6.5. Pitching a Cohesive Narrative
*   **Know Your Story:** For each credit, have a concise summary (1-2 minutes) of the borrower, the facility, key risks, mitigants, and why the rating is appropriate.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure your verbal narrative is consistent with the written documentation in the file. Discrepancies undermine credibility.
*   **Connect the Dots:** Explain how different pieces of information (e.g., industry trends, financial performance, management actions) fit together to support your rating conclusion.
*   **Use Visuals (if appropriate and allowed):** Simple charts showing key financial trends can sometimes be more effective than lengthy verbal explanations during discussions.

## 7. Responding to Examiner Queries Effectively

### 7.1. Clarity, Conciseness, Confidence
*   **Listen Carefully:** Understand the question before you answer.
*   **Be Direct:** Answer the question asked. Avoid rambling or providing excessive unrequested information initially.
*   **Be Fact-Based:** Ground your answers in data and analysis from the credit file.
*   **Be Confident (but not arrogant):** Show you know your credits and have done your due diligence. If you don't know an answer, say so and offer to find out.

### 7.2. Providing Supporting Documentation Promptly
*   If an examiner asks for specific data or a document to support your point, be able to locate it quickly in your (well-organized) credit file or system.
*   Delays in providing information can be perceived negatively.

### 7.3. Escalation and Disagreement Protocols (if applicable)
*   Understand your institution's internal policy for handling disagreements with examiner findings.
*   Generally, initial disagreements should be discussed professionally with the examiner-in-charge, providing factual counterpoints.
*   Further escalation typically involves more senior bank management and regulatory officials.

## 8. Post-Exam: Addressing Findings and Continuous Improvement

*   **Review Exam Report Carefully:** Understand all findings, recommendations, and any required actions (MRAs/MRIAs).
*   **Remediate Deficiencies:** Develop and execute action plans to address any identified weaknesses in credits or processes.
*   **Lessons Learned:** Conduct an internal post-mortem. What went well? What could be improved for next time? Use the exam as a learning opportunity to strengthen your credit risk management framework.
*   **Policy & Procedure Updates:** If findings indicate gaps in policy or procedure, ensure these are updated and staff are trained.

---

## 9. Tips & Tricks from the Trenches

*   **No Surprises (for yourself):** Know your portfolio's weaknesses before the examiners arrive. Downgrade credits proactively if warranted.
*   **The Agent Bank is Your Friend (usually):** If you are a participant, maintain good communication with the agent bank. They often have more direct interaction with the borrower and lead discussions with examiners.
*   **Understand the Macro Environment:** Be aware of current economic trends and how they might be impacting your borrowers and specific industries. Examiners will expect this broader context.
*   **Recent Events Matter:** If there's been a significant positive or negative event for a borrower right before or during an exam, be prepared to discuss its implications immediately.
*   **Consistency is Key:** Consistency in risk rating application, financial spreading, and policy adherence across the portfolio is viewed favorably.
*   **Don't Hide Bad News:** If a credit has problems, address them head-on in your documentation and discussions. Trying to obscure issues will likely backfire.
*   **Prepare Talking Points:** For key credits or potentially contentious ones, prepare concise talking points that cover your rationale and key mitigants.
*   **Stay Calm and Professional:** Exams can be stressful, but maintaining composure and a professional attitude is crucial.

This guide provides a framework for preparing for and navigating SNC exams. Effective preparation, robust documentation, a thorough understanding of guidelines, and clear communication are essential for a successful outcome.
