# SNC Exam Review: "EverBright Consumer Goods Inc." (Fictional)

**Date of Review:** 2025-11-15 (Simulated Late 2025 Exam)
**Origination Context:** Term Loan B originated Early 2025, rated 'Pass' at inception.

## Company Overview
- **Company Name:** EverBright Consumer Goods Inc. (Fictional)
- **Industry Sector:** Consumer Products (Sponsor-Backed)
- **Description:** Mid-cap portfolio company of a Private Equity sponsor, focused on branded consumer goods. Loan supported a dividend recapitalization and a bolt-on acquisition.

## Initial Underwriting Assumptions (Early 2025 - 'Pass' Rating)
- **Leverage (Debt/EBITDA):** ~4.8x (pro-forma for synergies)
- **Interest Coverage (ICR):** ~2.5x (based on then-current base rates + spread)
- **FCF:** Projected positive post-integration.
- **Qualitative:** Reputable sponsor, assumed stable industry, clear path to cost savings and synergies from acquisition.

## Current Situation & Simulated Agent Bank Data (Late 2025)
- **Leverage:** Debt-to-Equity ratio of 8.0 (equity eroded by losses). Debt/EBITDA > 7.0x (actual, not pro-forma).
- **Profitability:** Net Profit Margin of -10%. Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) of 0.5.
- **Liquidity & Coverage:** Current Ratio of 0.7. Multiple covenant breaches (Leverage, ICR).
- **Cash Flow:** Negative Free Cash Flow for several recent quarters (e.g., -$25M in latest quarter).
- **Payment Status:** 90+ days past due on recent interest payment; forbearance discussions ongoing. Borrower has requested interest capitalization, which was denied.
- **Collateral:** Primarily all assets, including brand/IP. Enterprise value estimated to be significantly below total debt outstanding (LTV > 1.0).
- **Qualitative Factors:** Sponsor-installed management team struggling with severe downturn; high employee turnover. Sharp decline in sales volumes due to consumer pullback and inability to compete on price. Synergies from bolt-on acquisition have not materialized. Unable to pass on persistent raw material and logistics cost inflation. Rapid decline in EBITDA leading to a liquidity crisis. Sponsor support has been limited to advisory, no new equity injected.

## SNC Regulatory Rating Assigned
**Rating: Substandard Non-Accrual**

## Detailed Justification for Rating
The **Substandard Non-Accrual** rating is assigned due to severe deterioration in financial condition and performance, making debt repayment in full highly improbable and warranting non-accrual status.

1.  **Critical Impairment of Repayment Capacity:**
    *   An Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) of 0.5 indicates earnings are grossly insufficient to cover interest expenses.
    *   Persistent negative Free Cash Flow demonstrates an inability to fund operations or service debt from internal cash generation.
    *   The company is 90+ days delinquent on its interest payments, a clear indicator of non-performance.
    *   *SNC Guideline Reference (Substandard):* "Inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor."
    *   *SNC Guideline Reference (Non-Accrual):* "Asset is maintained on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower...or full payment of principal and interest is not expected."

2.  **Operational Collapse & Failure to Realize Projections:**
    *   A sharp decline in sales and failure to achieve projected synergies from the acquisition have led to a collapse in EBITDA.
    *   Inability to manage cost inflation has severely compressed margins, resulting in significant net losses.
    *   The original 'Pass' rating was predicated on pro-forma adjustments and synergy realization that have proven to be unachievable.

3.  **Insufficient Collateral and High Leverage:**
    *   The enterprise value is now estimated to be below the outstanding debt, meaning collateral (including brand/IP) is insufficient to cover the loan.
    *   The Debt-to-Equity ratio has soared to 8.0, reflecting a deeply impaired capital structure.
    *   *SNC Guideline Reference (Substandard):* "Well-defined weakness(es) that jeopardize liquidation."

4.  **Non-Accrual Status Warranted:**
    *   Given the missed payments, ongoing losses, negative cash flow, and lack of a viable path to restore debt service capacity from operations in the near term, non-accrual of interest is appropriate. Continued accrual would overstate income and asset values for lenders.

**Semantic Kernel Skill Simulation Insights (Supporting Rationale):**
*   **Collateral Risk Assessment (Simulated):** `Substandard` - Enterprise value below debt, weak recovery prospects for intangibles in a forced sale.
*   **Repayment Capacity Assessment (Simulated):** `Unsustainable` - ICR significantly below 1.0, persistent negative FCF, no clear path to operational turnaround to cover debt service.
*   **Non-Accrual Status Indication (Simulated):** `Non-Accrual Warranted` - Payments missed (90+ days past due), severe financial deterioration, unsustainable repayment capacity, and unlikelihood of future payments without significant external intervention.

## Conclusion and Criteria Applied
"EverBright Consumer Goods Inc." has experienced a rapid and severe decline from its 'Pass' rating at origination. The failure to achieve operational targets, coupled with adverse market conditions and high leverage, has rendered the company unable to service its debt. The loan is inadequately protected, and collection in full is highly improbable. The **Substandard Non-Accrual** rating reflects the critical financial distress, payment delinquency, and the unlikelihood of the borrower to resume orderly payments from its own resources.
