# SNC Exam Review: "SynergyTech Dynamics Corp." (Fictional)

**Date of Review:** 2026-04-15 (Simulated Early 2026 Exam)
**Origination Context:** Large Syndicated Term Loan B originated Early 2026 to finance a major acquisition, rated 'Pass' at inception based on pro-forma estimates.

## Company Overview
- **Company Name:** SynergyTech Dynamics Corp. (Fictional)
- **Industry Sector:** Technology / Software
- **Description:** Growth-oriented technology company that recently completed a large, debt-financed acquisition of "TargetTech Inc." to achieve market expansion and cross-selling synergies.

## Initial Underwriting Assumptions (Early 2026 - 'Pass' Rating)
- **Leverage (Pro-forma Debt/EBITDA):** ~4.2x (combined entity, including aggressive synergy estimates and cost savings).
- **Interest Coverage (Pro-forma ICR):** ~3.0x.
- **Qualitative:** Strong strategic rationale for acquisition (complementary technology, new market access), detailed synergy realization plan, experienced management team assigned for integration. Assumed rapid EBITDA growth post-acquisition.

## Current Situation & Simulated Agent Bank Data (Mid-2026, ~6 months post-acquisition)
- **Integration Status:** Integration proving far more complex and costly than anticipated. Significant cultural clashes and departure of key technical and sales personnel from TargetTech.
- **Financial Performance vs. Pro-forma:**
    - Actual combined EBITDA for Q2 2026 is 40% below the pro-forma projections used at underwriting.
    - Anticipated cross-selling synergies have failed to materialize due to product integration delays and poor market reception of bundled offerings.
    - TargetTech's standalone product revenue is declining faster than expected due to customer uncertainty and staff departures.
- **Leverage & Coverage (Actual):**
    - Debt/EBITDA (actual, LTM Q2 2026): ~6.5x (spiked due to underperforming EBITDA).
    - ICR (actual, LTM Q2 2026): ~1.1x (severely weakened).
- **Cash Flow:** Negative Free Cash Flow due to higher-than-expected integration and restructuring costs, coupled with revenue shortfalls.
- **Covenants:** Expected to breach leverage and ICR covenants at Q2 2026 reporting. No cure apparent without significant new equity or asset sales (which are unlikely so soon post-acquisition).
- **Payment Status:** Currently making interest payments by drawing on remaining cash reserves from the acquisition financing, but liquidity is very tight. Next quarter's payment is at high risk if covenant breaches lead to default and acceleration, or if cash burn continues at current rate. (For this exam, we assume an imminent default post-review if no new funding materializes).
- **Collateral:** All assets of combined entity, primarily software IP and customer contracts. Significant goodwill booked from acquisition is now likely impaired.
- **Qualitative Factors:** Management credibility damaged due to missed targets. Market sentiment towards the company has turned negative. Economic slowdown is also impacting enterprise tech spending, further pressuring sales.

## SNC Regulatory Rating Assigned
**Rating: Substandard Non-Accrual**

## Detailed Justification for Rating
The **Substandard Non-Accrual** rating is assigned due to a severe failure to achieve post-acquisition financial targets, leading to critically impaired repayment capacity and a high likelihood of sustained payment default.

1.  **Failure of Acquisition to Meet Projections:**
    *   Actual EBITDA is drastically (40%) below the pro-forma figures that supported the 'Pass' rating at origination. This indicates a fundamental flaw in underwriting assumptions, synergy realization, or integration execution.
    *   The strategic rationale for the acquisition has not translated into financial benefits; instead, performance has deteriorated.
    *   *SNC Guideline Reference (Substandard):* "Paying capacity of the obligor" is inadequately protected when based on projections that prove unachievable.

2.  **Critically Weakened Debt Service Capacity:**
    *   The actual ICR of ~1.1 provides almost no buffer, and with negative FCF and declining trends, the ability to service the large acquisition debt is severely compromised.
    *   The company is funding current interest payments from remaining cash, not operational earnings, which is unsustainable.
    *   Imminent covenant breaches are expected, which could trigger default and limit access to further liquidity.

3.  **Impaired Collateral and Goodwill:**
    *   The significant goodwill recognized from the acquisition is likely impaired due to the underperformance of TargetTech and the failure of synergy realization. This erodes the asset base supporting the loan.
    *   The value of software IP and customer contracts from the acquired entity is diminished by staff departures and product integration issues.
    *   *SNC Guideline Reference (Substandard):* "Well-defined weakness(es) that jeopardize liquidation."

4.  **High Likelihood of Payment Default & Non-Accrual Warranted:**
    *   Given the negative cash flow, tight liquidity, imminent covenant breaches, and dramatically underperforming EBITDA, the company is unlikely to be able to meet future debt service obligations without new external funding, which is uncertain.
    *   Assuming no immediate cure for covenant breaches or new funding post this exam point, a payment default is highly probable, warranting non-accrual status.
    *   *SNC Guideline Reference (Non-Accrual):* "Full payment of principal and interest is not expected."

**Semantic Kernel Skill Simulation Insights (Supporting Rationale):**
*   **Collateral Risk Assessment (Simulated):** `Substandard` - Value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill is highly questionable given integration failures and poor performance. Significant risk of write-downs.
*   **Repayment Capacity Assessment (Simulated):** `Weak` to `Unsustainable` - Actual EBITDA is dramatically underperforming pro-forma projections, making the current debt load difficult to service. ICR is critically low and FCF is negative.
*   **Non-Accrual Status Indication (Simulated):** `Non-Accrual Warranted` - Given imminent covenant breaches, rapid deterioration in performance versus underwriting, and high likelihood that future payments cannot be made from operational cash flow.

## Conclusion and Criteria Applied
The acquisition financed by this syndicated loan has demonstrably failed to meet its initial financial projections and strategic objectives within a short period. "SynergyTech Dynamics Corp." is facing a severe financial strain due to underperforming EBITDA, negative cash flow, and an unsustainable debt burden relative to actual earnings. Imminent covenant breaches and the high probability of payment default justify the **Substandard Non-Accrual** rating. This represents a rapid deterioration from the initial 'Pass' assessment, driven by the high risks associated with large, aggressively underwritten, debt-financed acquisitions.
