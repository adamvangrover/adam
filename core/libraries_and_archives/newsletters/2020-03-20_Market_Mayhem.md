## Thematic Deep Dive: "The Velocity of Money vs. The Velocity of Viral Spread"

We are witnessing a race. The virus spreads exponentially, shutting down economic activity. The Fed creates money exponentially, trying to fill the hole.

Currently, the virus is winning. But don't underestimate the power of infinite liquidity. Once the infection curve flattens, the liquidity curve will remain vertical. We might see the sharpest recession followed by the sharpest recovery in history.

## Year Ahead Forecast

**Neutral.** We are likely near a tradable bottom, but the V-shaped recovery depends entirely on the virus. Don't try to be a hero—dollar cost average into high-quality tech.
