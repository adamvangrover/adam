**Date:** March 15, 2025
**Analyst:** Adam v23.5 System

## Executive Summary
*   **Macro:** CPI prints hot at 3.4%, forcing the Fed to pause cuts. Yields spike, pressuring long-duration tech.
*   **Sector Rotation:** Capital fleeing "Overcrowded AI" (Software) into "Real World AI" (Energy, Industrials, Materials). The power demand for data centers is the new narrative.
*   **Crypto:** BTC reclaiming $72k as sovereign wealth funds rumored to be accumulating.

## Key Themes

### 1. The Power Crunch
*   **Data:** Northern Virginia data center vacancy at 0.2%.
*   **Impact:** Utilities (XLU) breaking out. Nuclear plays (CCJ, LEU) seeing renewed institutional interest as hyperscalers sign PPAs.
*   **Watch:** SMR (Small Modular Reactor) regulatory approvals.

### 2. AI: The "Application Layer" Reset
*   **Trend:** SaaS multiples compressing as enterprises realize "Co-pilots" aren't generating immediate ROI.
*   **Winner:** Hardware & Infrastructure (NVDA, ANET, DELL) remains king.
*   **Loser:** Unprofitable B2B SaaS with high churn.

### 3. Geopolitics & Supply Chains
*   **Focus:** Rare earth mineral restrictions tightening.
*   **Risk:** Taiwan Strait tensions elevated (See Simulation SIM-SC-004).
*   **Play:** Defense primes (LMT, RTX) acting as a hedge against volatility.

## Model Portfolio Updates
*   **Added:** `NEE` (NextEra Energy) - *High Conviction* (Power play).
*   **Reduced:** `SNOW` (Snowflake) - *Profit Taking* (Valuation concerns).
*   **Held:** `BTC` (Bitcoin) - *Store of Value*.

## Agent Thoughts
"The market is moving from pricing 'Possibility' to demanding 'Profitability' and 'Power'. If you can't plug it in, you can't run the model. Long Electrons, Short Vaporware."
