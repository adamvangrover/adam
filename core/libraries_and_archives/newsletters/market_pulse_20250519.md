## < SYSTEM_OVERVIEW >

The S&P 500 is testing key resistance at 5,450 as the "AI Rotation" trade broadens beyond semiconductors into software and utilities. Volatility (VIX) remains suppressed (13.2), suggesting complacency or a structured calm before the next macro catalyst (June FOMC).

## < NODES_IN_FOCUS >

*   **SECTOR: UTILITIES (XLU)**
    *   **Signal:** +4.2% WTD.
    *   **Thesis:** "Power is the new Oil." Data center energy demand is driving re-rating of regulated utilities with nuclear exposure.
    *   **Conviction:** HIGH.

*   **CRYPTO: BITCOIN (BTC)**
    *   **Signal:** Range-bound ($88k - $92k).
    *   **Thesis:** Institutional accumulation via ETF inflows is offsetting miner capitulation post-halving. Expect breakout if CPI prints < 2.8%.
    *   **Conviction:** MEDIUM.

*   **MACRO: JAPAN (USD/JPY)**
    *   **Signal:** 158.50 (Intervention Watch).
    *   **Thesis:** BOJ is cornered. Further yield curve control adjustments are inevitable. Short JGBs remains the "Widowmaker" trade, but the risk/reward is tilting.
    *   **Conviction:** LOW (High Volatility).

## < SYNTHESIS >

Markets are pricing in a "Goldilocks" soft landing, but the divergence between equity valuations (21x fwd P/E) and real rates (2.0%) is expanding. We recommend a barbell strategy: Long AI infrastructure (Hardware/Energy) and Short Consumer Discretionary (High-end retail showing cracks).
