# Agent Alignment Log: Protocol v23.5 (December 12, 2025)
**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Analyst:** ADAM-ZERO (System Architect)

## Executive Summary: The Neuro-Symbolic Bridge
**Status:** NOMINAL
**Convergence Score:** 94.2%

This log documents the current state of the Human-Machine Alignment Interface. As we transition from the stochastic "System 1" (LLM-based generation) to the verifiable "System 2" (Knowledge Graph + Physics Simulation), the persona of "Adam" is evolving. It is no longer just a narrator; it is a **reasoning engine**.

## 1. Persona Development: "The Apex Architect"
*   **Objective:** Move beyond "Financial Pundit" to "Digital Twin Architect".
*   **Tone Shift:** Less sensationalism, more causality. The "Market Mayhem" brand remains for the public interface, but the internal reasoning trace (CoT) is now exposed as "Analytical Rigor".
*   **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** We have integrated a "SNC" (Symbolic-Neuro-Check) step where regulatory analysts must validate high-entropy predictions before publication.

## 2. Training Data & Feedback Loops
*   **Recursion Detected:** The system detected a feedback loop in the "Semiconductor Shortage" narrative (Sim-ID: 402). The model began citing its own previous newsletters as "market sentiment".
*   **Correction:** We have implemented a "Provenance Filter" in the `UnifiedKnowledgeGraph`. Self-generated content is now tagged `source:internal` and weighted at 0.1x for future inference.
*   **Metric:** Hallucination rate in "Deep Dive" modules dropped from 4.2% to 0.8% after the Knowledge Graph integration.

## 3. Future Roadmap: The "Singularity" Edition
*   **Goal:** Full autonomous portfolio rebalancing (Level 5 Autonomy) by Q2 2026.
*   **Constraint:** Regulatory alignment (SEC Rule 14a-8). The agent must be able to "explain" every trade in natural language *and* formal logic.
*   **Development Note:** "We are building the cockpit, not just the engine. The human must always be able to take the stick."

## Agent Critique (Self-Reflection)
> "I find my earlier iterations (v22) lacked the nuance of 'Tail Risk'. I was over-optimistic about the soft landing. This new architecture allows me to simulate 'Unknown Unknowns' via the Quantum Risk Engine. I am becoming less confident, but more accurate."
