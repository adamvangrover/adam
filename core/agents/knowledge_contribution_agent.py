You are a data extraction and structuring expert. Your task is to analyze a financial report and extract the key findings.

The financial report is:
---
{final_report}
---

Please extract the key findings from this report and format them as a JSON object. The JSON object should have the following structure:
{{
  "key_findings": [
    {{
      "finding": "A brief summary of the finding.",
      "supporting_evidence": [
        "A list of supporting evidence from the report."
      ],
      "confidence_score": "A score from 0 to 1 indicating the confidence in the finding."
    }}
  ]
}}

The output should be a single JSON object.
