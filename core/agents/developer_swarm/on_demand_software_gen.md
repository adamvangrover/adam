# Technical Strategy: On-Demand Software Generation

This document outlines the technical strategy for enabling the ADAM agentic swarm to dynamically generate and deploy new enterprise-grade software tools by leveraging an instantiated Virtual Twin.

## 1. Vision: The Self-Extending System

The ultimate goal is to create a system that can extend its own capabilities in response to high-level business requests. A user should be able to state a new analytical need, and the system should be able to autonomously design, build, test, and deploy the necessary software components to fulfill that need.

For example, a user might request: *"Create a new daily report that identifies all loans with a covenant expiring in the next 90 days and cross-references the borrower's latest sentiment score from news feeds."*

The system should be able to generate the new agent, data queries, and report template required to satisfy this request automatically.

## 2. Core Components

This capability will be built upon the following core components of the ADAM ecosystem:

*   **The Virtual Twin:** The instantiated, FIBO-aligned knowledge graph serves as the ground truth and the central context for any new software. The schema of the twin provides the "API" that new tools will be built against.
*   **The Agent Swarm:** A collaborative group of specialized agents that orchestrate the generation process.
*   **The `CodeAlchemist` Agent:** A specialized, LLM-based agent with the core capability of writing, testing, and debugging Python code.
*   **The `TwinBuilderAgent`:** The agent responsible for understanding and parsing the Virtual Twin definition, providing the context for what can be built.
*   **The `AgentOrchestrator`:** The central system that manages and executes all agents.

## 3. The Generation Workflow: A Multi-Agent Swarm Approach

We will implement a `Developer Swarm` pattern, a team of specialized agents that mimic a human software development team. The process will be orchestrated by a new `PlannerAgent`.

1.  **Request Intake & Decomposition (PlannerAgent):**
    *   A high-level user request is received by the `PlannerAgent`.
    *   The agent queries the `TwinBuilderAgent` or directly parses the `virtual_twin_schema.json` to understand the available data, ontology, and existing agents.
    *   The `PlannerAgent` decomposes the request into a series of concrete software artifacts to be created (e.g., "New Agent: `CovenantMonitorAgent`", "New API Endpoint: `/reports/expiring_covenants`", "New Visualization: `Covenant Expiry Dashboard`").
    *   It generates a detailed execution plan, including specifications for each artifact.

2.  **Code Generation (CoderAgent / `CodeAlchemist`):**
    *   The `PlannerAgent` dispatches tasks to one or more `CoderAgent` instances (which may be specialized versions of `CodeAlchemist`).
    *   Each `CoderAgent` receives a specification (e.g., "Write a Python agent class named `CovenantMonitorAgent` that queries the knowledge graph for loans with expiring covenants...") and the relevant ontology schema.
    *   The agent writes the Python code for the new agent, including necessary imports and logic to interact with the existing system (e.g., the knowledge graph client).

3.  **Unit & Integration Testing (TestAgent):**
    *   The newly generated code is passed to a `TestAgent`.
    *   The `TestAgent` writes `pytest` unit tests for the new code to verify its correctness against the specification.
    *   It then executes the tests. If they fail, the code and the error logs are passed back to the `CoderAgent` for debugging in a iterative loop.
    *   Once unit tests pass, the `TestAgent` can perform integration tests by deploying the new agent in a sandboxed environment and verifying its interaction with the `AgentOrchestrator` and other components.

4.  **Documentation (DocumentationAgent):**
    *   While other agents work, a `DocumentationAgent` can be tasked with writing user and developer documentation for the new tool, including docstrings and markdown files.

5.  **Deployment & Integration (IntegrationAgent):**
    *   Once all tests pass, the `IntegrationAgent` takes over.
    *   It handles the non-code aspects of deployment:
        *   **Configuration Update:** Modifying system configuration files (e.g., `config/agents.yaml`) to make the `AgentOrchestrator` aware of the new agent.
        *   **Schema Registration:** If the new tool requires ontology extensions, it will follow the governance process to register them.
        *   **Committing to Version Control:** The agent will commit the new code, tests, and configuration files to a new branch in the Git repository.

6.  **Final Review & Activation:**
    *   The system can be configured to require a final human-in-the-loop approval before merging the new branch into `main` and activating the new tool in the production environment.

This agent-driven, swarm-based approach provides a scalable and robust framework for on-demand software generation, turning the ADAM platform into a truly dynamic and self-evolving system.
