# Guide to Model Validation using the Prompt Library

## Introduction

This guide is designed to help you leverage our comprehensive JSON prompt library to generate insightful challenges to financial models. The goal of this library is to provide a structured framework for your model validation process, ensuring that all critical aspects of a model are considered.

## Overview of the Prompt Library JSON Structure

The provided JSON file is the backbone of your analysis. It's organized into several key sections:

* **`prompt_metadata`**: Contains general information about the prompt library version and author.
* **`core_validation_areas`**: This is the heart of the library. It's an array of individual prompt objects, each designed to tackle a specific model validation task. Each prompt has an `id`, `title`, `description`, `instructions`, and a crucial list of `key_considerations`.

Your main focus will be on the `core_validation_areas`, as these provide the building blocks for your model validation process.

## How to Use This Guide

This document will walk you through the typical workflow of a model validation process. Each step in the process corresponds to a specific section of a standard model validation checklist. For each step, this guide will:

1.  **Identify the relevant prompt(s)** from the library by its `prompt_title` and `(prompt_id)`.
2.  **Summarize the objective** of that validation task.
3.  **List key questions** you should answer, based on the `key_considerations` in the prompt, to build your validation checklist.

Think of this guide as a roadmap and the prompt library as your toolkit.
