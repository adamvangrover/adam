# ADAM Prompt Library

Welcome to the ADAM Prompt Library! This library provides a comprehensive collection of prompts for a variety of financial analysis and communication tasks. The prompts are designed to be used with large language models (LLMs) to help you generate high-quality, consistent, and insightful content.

*   **`credit_analysis`**: Prompts for conducting corporate credit risk analysis, underwriting, review, and monitoring.
*   **`due_diligence`**: Prompts for conducting due diligence on a company.
*   **`market_analysis`**: Prompts for conducting market analysis, including daily briefings, sector deep dives, and risk assessments.

*   **`communication`**: Prompts for generating professional communications, such as escalation emails.

Each module contains a JSON file with the prompts and a Markdown file with a guide on how to use them.
