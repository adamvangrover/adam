# PROMPT: Financial Infrastructure Cyber-Attack
**ID:** SIM-CYBER-002
**Tags:** [Cybersecurity, Systemic Risk, Banking, Crisis]

## Scenario
**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Event:** "Project Blackout"
A sophisticated ransomware group (allegedly state-sponsored) has breached the settlement layer of a major clearing house (e.g., DTCC or Euroclear). Trade reconciliation is frozen.
**Market Impact:**
*   **Liquidity:** Interbank lending freezes (FRA-OIS spread widens 50bps).
*   **Operations:** Major custodians cannot verify cash positions.
*   **Volatility:** VIX spikes to 60 as panic sets in.

## Task
You are the **COO (Chief Operating Officer)** of a Global Asset Manager.
1.  **Operational Continuity:** Define protocols to value the portfolio in the absence of market prints (Mark-to-Model).
2.  **Counterparty Risk:** Assess exposure to Prime Brokers who may face margin calls they cannot meet due to frozen collateral.
3.  **Client Communication:** Draft a memo to LPs (Limited Partners) explaining why redemptions are temporarily gated.
4.  **Recovery Plan:** Outline the steps to reconcile trades manually once the system comes back online.

## Output Format
*   **Crisis Memo:** Internal directive to all Portfolio Managers.
*   **LP Letter:** External communication (reassuring but firm).
*   **Risk Dashboard:** Key metrics to watch (e.g., Repo Rates, Fail-to-Deliver counts).

## Constraints
*   Assume the outage lasts 48 hours.
*   Focus on operational and reputational risk.
