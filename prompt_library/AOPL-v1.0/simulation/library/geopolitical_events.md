### Scenario GEO-001: Sudden Declaration of Tariffs

**Description:** A major trading partner nation unexpectedly imposes a 50% tariff on goods manufactured in our primary country of operation. The tariff takes effect in 48 hours, catching our logistics and finance departments completely by surprise.

**Potential Primary Impact Nodes:**
*   **R-SCM-01 (Supply Chain Risk):** The cost of goods sold skyrockets, making products uncompetitive in that market.
*   **R-FIN-01 (Financial Reporting Risk):** Revenue forecasts for the affected region must be immediately and drastically revised downwards.
*   **R-LGL-01 (Regulatory Risk):** Existing contracts with distributors in the target nation may be breached due to inability to supply goods at the agreed price.

### Scenario GEO-002: Regional Conflict Erupts

**Description:** A shooting war breaks out in a region where we have significant manufacturing facilities and a large employee base. Martial law is declared, transportation is commandeered by the military, and the internet is shut down. All communication with our local facilities is lost.

**Potential Primary Impact Nodes:**
*   **R-EMP-01 (Employee Safety Risk):** The immediate physical safety of our employees is at high risk.

### Scenario GEO-003: Expropriation of Assets

**Description:** The government of a country where we hold significant assets (e.g., data centers, real estate, intellectual property) announces the nationalization of all foreign-owned assets in our industry sector. All access to our local subsidiary is blocked, and its assets are seized.

**Potential Primary Impact Nodes:**
*   **R-OPS-02 (Physical Asset Risk):** Total and permanent loss of all physical assets in the country.
*   **R-LGL-02 (Legal Risk):** Our legal ownership of the subsidiary and its IP is challenged, leading to protracted and expensive international legal battles.

### Scenario GEO-004: Key Waterway Blocked

**Description:** A major global shipping lane (e.g., the Suez Canal, Strait of Hormuz) is blocked due to a geopolitical incident. Dozens of our container ships are trapped, and all inbound and outbound sea freight is indefinitely delayed. Shipping rates on alternative routes surge by 500% overnight.

**Potential Primary Impact Nodes:**
*   **R-SCM-01 (Supply Chain Risk):** Production lines will halt within days due to a lack of raw materials.
*   **R-FIN-03 (Liquidity Risk):** We must make massive, unplanned expenditures on air freight to keep critical operations running.
*   **R-OPS-01 (Operational Risk):** Inability to deliver finished goods to customers results in penalties and lost orders.
