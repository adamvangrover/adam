# Crisis Simulation Library: Technological Disruption Scenarios

This library provides a set of user-ready scenarios focused on **Technological Disruptions**, including AI-related risks. These can be used as the `{{USER_SCENARIO_INPUT}}` in the main `crisis_simulation.md` prompt.

### Scenario TEC-001: AI-Powered Competitor Emerges

**Description:** A previously unknown startup, leveraging a breakthrough generative AI technology, launches a product that is 10x cheaper and 5x faster than our flagship offering. Our sales pipeline evaporates in a single quarter as customers flock to the new solution. Our multi-year product roadmap is now obsolete.

**Potential Primary Impact Nodes:**
*   **R-STR-02 (Market Position Risk):** Our core business model is fundamentally disrupted. We have lost our competitive advantage.
*   **R-FIN-01 (Financial Reporting Risk):** Projected revenues are no longer achievable, leading to a massive stock price correction.
*   **R-EMP-02 (Talent Risk):** Key employees, seeing the "writing on the wall," begin to leave for more innovative competitors.

### Scenario TEC-002: Malicious Use of AI (Deepfake Attack)

**Description:** A highly realistic deepfake video of our CEO and CFO is released on social media. In the video, they appear to announce a massive accounting fraud and an emergency bankruptcy filing. The video goes viral before it can be debunked, causing panic among investors, employees, and creditors.

**Potential Primary Impact Nodes:**
*   **R-REP-01 (Reputational Risk):** The company's credibility is destroyed, even after the video is proven to be fake.
*   **R-FIN-02 (Market Risk):** The stock price crashes on the false news. High-frequency trading algorithms automatically sell based on the headline.
*   **R-LGL-01 (Regulatory Risk):** Regulators may launch an investigation based on the video, forcing the company to spend significant resources responding.

### Scenario TEC-003: Catastrophic AI Model Failure

**Description:** A critical, customer-facing AI system (e.g., a credit scoring model, a medical diagnostic tool) is discovered to have a deeply embedded, systemic bias that has been causing harm to a protected class of individuals for years. The flaw is made public, and a class-action lawsuit is filed.

**Potential Primary Impact Nodes:**
*   **R-MDL-01 (Model Risk):** The core of the AI system is fundamentally flawed and cannot be trusted. The entire system must be shut down.
*   **R-LGL-03 (Product Liability Risk):** The company is liable for the damages caused by its biased AI.
*   **R-REP-01 (Reputational Risk):** The company is branded as irresponsible and unethical in its use of AI.

### Scenario TEC-004: Quantum Computing Breaks Encryption

**Description:** A state-level actor announces it has developed a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer capable of breaking current industry-standard encryption (e.g., RSA-2048) in a matter of hours. All our "secure" data, including customer information, trade secrets, and financial records, is now considered vulnerable.

**Potential Primary Impact Nodes:**
*   **R-CYB-02 (Data Breach Risk):** All sensitive data, both in transit and at rest, is at immediate risk of exposure.
*   **R-OPS-04 (IT & Systems Risk):** Every system and application that relies on public key cryptography is now insecure. A company-wide, emergency migration to quantum-resistant cryptography is required.
*   **R-STR-01 (Strategic Risk):** Our ability to conduct business securely is compromised, threatening the very foundation of the company.
