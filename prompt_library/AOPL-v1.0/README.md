# Adam-Optimized Prompt Library (AOPL-v1.0)

This directory contains the Adam-Optimized Prompt Library (AOPL), a collection of "game-changing" prompt templates designed to bridge the worlds of Corporate Credit Risk and Agentic AI System Architecture.

## Usage

Each prompt is stored in its own detailed Markdown file, named according to its unique ID. Each file contains:

*   **Metadata:** A versioned ID, objective, and suggested use cases.
*   **Configuration:** Key placeholders and detailed pro-tips for integrating the prompt into an agentic AI framework like "Adam."
*   **Example Usage:** A concrete example of how to fill in the placeholders.
*   **Full Template:** The complete, robust, and ready-to-use prompt.

## Structure

The library is organized into three categories, each in its own subdirectory:

*   `/learning`: Prompts designed to leverage AI to rapidly master new, complex domains by connecting them directly to existing expertise.
*   `/professional_outcomes`: Prompts designed to automate and enhance core professional work in credit risk.
*   `/system_architecture`: "Meta-prompts" designed to help build, refine, and manage AI systems.

Each prompt is stored in its own Markdown file, named according to its unique ID (e.g., `LIB-LRN-001.md`).
