4.  **Risk Assessment:** Identify key risks (e.g., customer concentration, raw material price volatility) and structural mitigants.
5.  **Covenant Structure:** Propose financial covenants (e.g., Max Leverage 3.5x, Min FCCR 1.25x).

## Output Format
*   **Executive Summary:** 1-page high-level overview with the recommendation.
*   **Detailed Analysis:** Sections for Industry, Management, Financials, and Structure.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** What happens if EBITDA drops 20%?
