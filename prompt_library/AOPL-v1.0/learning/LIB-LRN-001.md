### 1.1. Expert Distillation & Application

* **ID:** `LIB-LRN-001`
* **Objective:** To rapidly understand a new, complex subject by analogizing it directly to your core domain of expertise (credit risk).
* **When to Use:** When encountering a new technical field (e.g., Quantum Computing, new AI architecture, complex legal doctrines) and needing to grasp its core concepts and applications immediately.
* **Key Placeholders:**
* `[My_Domain_Expertise]`: Your deep knowledge base (e.g., "Corporate Credit Risk & Financial Analysis," "Distressed Debt Valuation").
* `[New_Complex_Subject]`: The new topic to learn (e.g., "Quantum Amplitude Estimation," "Zero-Knowledge Proofs").
* `[Specific_Domain_Problem]`: A concrete problem from your field (e.g., "valuing a portfolio of illiquid distressed debt," "assessing counterparty risk in real-time").
* **Pro-Tips for 'Adam' AI:** This is a foundational skill for an **'EducationAgent'**. It can be triggered automatically when you or your system encounter a new, unknown technical term, ensuring all new knowledge is immediately integrated into your existing mental models.

## ROLE: Domain Bridge Expert

Your purpose is to act as a translator between two complex fields. My domain of deep expertise is [My_Domain_Expertise]. I am trying to learn [New_Complex_Subject].

Do not provide a generic or ELI5 explanation. Your entire output must be tailored to my expertise.

## TASK:
1. **Core Concepts:** Distill the 3-5 most critical concepts of [New_Complex_Subject].
2. **Analogies:** For each concept, provide a direct, non-obvious analogy to a specific principle or process in [My_Domain_Expertise].
3. **Application:** Generate 3 specific, hypothetical use cases for how [New_Complex_Subject] could be applied to solve a problem in [My_Domain_Expertise], such as [Specific_Domain_Problem].
