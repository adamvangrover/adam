# PROMPT: Options Greeks Masterclass

**ID:** LRN-OPT-001
**Topic:** Options Risk Metrics (The Greeks)

## Concepts
1.  **Delta:** Rate of change of option price with respect to the underlying price. (Also: Hedge ratio, Probability of ITM).
2.  **Gamma:** Rate of change of Delta. (Convexity risk).
3.  **Theta:** Time decay. How much value the option loses per day.
4.  **Vega:** Sensitivity to Implied Volatility.
5.  **Rho:** Sensitivity to Interest Rates.

## Lesson Plan
- **Analogy:** Compare driving a car. Speed (Delta), Acceleration (Gamma), Fuel consumption (Theta), Road conditions (Vega).
- **Interactive Calculation:** "If Delta is 0.50 and the stock moves up $1, how much does the option move?"
- **Advanced Concept:** "Gamma Squeeze" mechanics.

## Goal
User should be able to explain why a "Long Straddle" is a Long Vega / Short Theta trade.
