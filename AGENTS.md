# Welcome to the ADAM Project!

This document provides guidance for AI agents working with the ADAM codebase.

## High-Level Goal

The primary goal of the ADAM project is to create a sophisticated, autonomous AI system that can perform complex financial analysis, generate insightful reports, and adapt to new information and user requirements.

## Core Principles

When working on the ADAM project, please adhere to the following principles:

*   **Modularity:** Keep code modular and well-documented. Each component should have a clear purpose and interface.
*   **Extensibility:** Design components to be easily extended and adapted for new use cases.
*   **Robustness:** Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to ensure the system is resilient and debuggable.
*   **Efficiency:** Optimize code for performance, especially in data-intensive and computationally expensive tasks.

## System Architecture

The ADAM system is built on a modular architecture that consists of several key components. These components work together to provide a flexible and extensible platform for building and deploying autonomous agents.

### Key Components

*   **Agents:** Autonomous agents that perform specific tasks, such as data retrieval, analysis, and reporting. Agents are the core of the ADAM system and are responsible for carrying out the main logic of the application.
*   **Core:** The central infrastructure that supports the agents, including the main loop, data management, and communication. The core provides the essential services that agents need to operate, such as a message bus for inter-agent communication and a data store for persisting information.
*   **Data Sources:** Modules for accessing various data sources, such as APIs and databases. Data sources provide a standardized interface for retrieving data, regardless of the underlying source.
*   **LLM Engine:** The language model engine that provides natural language processing capabilities. The LLM engine is used for tasks such as text generation, summarization, and question answering.
*   **Simulations:** Environments for testing and evaluating the agents' performance. Simulations provide a controlled environment for running experiments and measuring key performance indicators.

### Component Interaction

The components of the ADAM system interact with each other in the following way:

1.  The **core** initializes the system and starts the main loop.
2.  The **core** loads the **agents** and other components based on the configuration files.
3.  **Agents** use the **data sources** to retrieve data from various sources.
4.  **Agents** use the **LLM engine** to perform natural language processing tasks.
5.  **Agents** communicate with each other through the **core's** message bus.
6.  **Simulations** use the **core** to run experiments and evaluate the performance of the **agents**.

## Getting Started

To get started, please familiarize yourself with the following:

*   **`config/`:** This directory contains the configuration files for the system.
*   **`core/`:** This directory contains the core components of the system.
*   **`docs/`:** This directory contains the documentation for the system.
*   **`tests/`:** This directory contains the tests for the system.

## Contribution Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines when contributing to the ADAM project:

*   Write clear and concise commit messages.
*   Update the documentation when adding new features or changing existing ones.
*   Write unit tests for all new code.
*   Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

Thank you for your contributions to the ADAM project!
