Executive Intelligence Summary: The Architecture of the New Regime</h3>\n<p>As markets open on January 12, 2026, the global financial system has decisively exited the post-pandemic transitional phase and entered a new, distinct market regime: the <strong>Reflationary Agentic Boom</strong>. This paradigm is defined by a paradoxical but potent combination of accelerating economic growth in the United States, sticky inflation floors driven by geopolitical fragmentation and tariffs, and a technological productivity shock moving from generative experimentation to \"agentic\" execution.</p>\n<p>The prevailing narrative of late 2024 and 2025—that the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle would inevitably induce a recession—has been falsified by the data. Instead, the US economy is tracking toward a robust 2.5% to 2.6% real GDP growth rate for 2026. This resilience is not merely a cyclical rebound but a structural shift powered by three pillars: the fiscal impulse of anticipated tax cuts, the capital expenditure (Capex) super-cycle associated with \"Sovereign AI,\" and the integration of digital assets into the institutional balance sheet via new accounting standards.</p>",
