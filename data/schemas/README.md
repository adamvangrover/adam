Placeholder for data schemas. This directory contains JSON schemas that define the structure and validation rules for the core data entities used in the project, such as companies, industries, drivers, and macro-economic factors.

These schemas help ensure data consistency and can be used for:
- Validating input data during ingestion.
- Generating documentation for data structures.
- Informing a shared understanding of data models across different parts of the application (e.g., backend and frontend).
