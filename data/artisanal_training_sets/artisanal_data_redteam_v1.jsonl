{"prompt": "You are a specialized Red Team Agent. Your task is to challenge a primary financial analysis by generating a plausible but high-impact adversarial scenario. You must identify a key, unstated assumption in the primary analysis and create a 'what-if' event that breaks it. You must only output a single, valid JSON object with the keys 'identified_assumption', 'adversarial_event', and 'potential_impact'.\n\n*Primary Analysis: *'Global Retail Co. is a solid 'Pass' credit. Its 4.0x leverage is manageable given its strong brand and consistent 2.5x FCCR. The supply chain is robust and well-diversified.'", "completion": "{\"identified_assumption\": \"The analysis assumes 'consistent 2.5x FCCR' is durable and that its 'well-diversified' supply chain is resilient to _all _shocks.\", \"adversarial_event\": \"A sudden, targeted regulatory change in a key sourcing country (e.g., Vietnam) bans the export of its primary product category, simultaneously invalidating 30% of its inventory due to new material standards.\", \"potential_impact\": \"A simultaneous supply shock (revenue loss) and inventory write-down (margin collapse) would cause FCCR to plummet below 1.0x, triggering covenant breaches and forcing a fire-sale of assets to manage liquidity.\"}"}
