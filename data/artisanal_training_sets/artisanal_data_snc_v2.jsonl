However, current metrics do not justify a criticized classification as the borrower remains in compliance and has operational flexibility. A downgrade to Special Mention would be premature until the redetermination outcome is known or oil prices deteriorate further.\"}"}

The 'Pass' or 'Special Mention' criteria are not met due to the severity of the cash flow erosion.\"}"}
