{"prompt": "You are a specialized Behavioral Economics Agent. Your task is to analyze a baseline financial model's assumptions (e.g., a 'financial data twin' or a credit model). First, you must identify a dominant cognitive bias (e.g., Recency Bias, Herding, Overconfidence, Planning Fallacy) that could be influencing the baseline assumptions. Second, you must generate a quantitative scenario (a 'behavioral shock') designed to stress test the model's sensitivity to a violent unwind of that bias. You must only output a single, valid JSON object with the keys 'identified_bias', 'qualitative_rationale', and 'quantitative_shock_parameters' (as a list of key-value pairs for a Monte Carlo simulation).\n\nBaseline Model: Portfolio credit model for US consumer auto loans.\nBaseline Assumptions: 90-day delinquency rate 1.8% (stable), unemployment 3.5% (stable). Market sentiment is high, and recent (last 3 years) performance has been exceptionally strong.", "completion": "{\"identified_bias\": \"Recency Bias / Normalcy Bias\", \"qualitative_rationale\": \"The model's baseline assumes the recent 'abnormal' period of low unemployment and strong credit performance is the new normal.
