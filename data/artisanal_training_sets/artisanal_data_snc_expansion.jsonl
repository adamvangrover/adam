{"prompt": "Analyze the following credit facility for SNC classification:\nBorrower: RetailChain Corp.\nSector: Retail\nLeverage: 6.2x Total Debt / EBITDA\nInterest Coverage: 1.8x\nCollateral: Inventory and Real Estate\nPerformance: Same store sales declining -5% YoY. Recent covenant waiver requested.", "completion": "Rating: Special Mention\nRationale: Leverage is high (6.2x) and cash flow coverage is tight (1.8x). Declining same-store sales indicate operational weakness. The request for a covenant waiver suggests potential inability to meet original terms, warranting close monitoring (Special Mention) but not yet Substandard as no payment default has occurred."}
{"prompt": "Analyze the following credit facility for SNC classification:\nBorrower: OilDrill LLP\nSector: Energy\nLeverage: 8.0x Total Debt / EBITDA\nInterest Coverage: 0.8x\nCollateral: Rigs and Equipment (Depreciating)\nPerformance: EBITDA negative for last 2 quarters. Liquidity < 3 months of runway.", "completion": "Rating: Substandard\nRationale: The borrower relies on secondary sources of repayment (asset sale) as primary cash flow is insufficient (Interest Coverage < 1.0x).

{"prompt": "Analyze the following credit facility for SNC classification:\nBorrower: ZombieCo\nSector: Manufacturing\nLeverage: 10x\nStatus: Chapter 11 Filing Imminent\nCollateral: Fully encumbered, liquidation analysis shows 40 cents on the dollar.", "completion": "Rating: Doubtful\nRationale: Full repayment is highly improbable.
