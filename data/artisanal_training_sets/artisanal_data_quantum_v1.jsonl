{"prompt": "Analyze the tail risk of a 60/40 portfolio using Quantum Monte Carlo simulation with a Jump-Diffusion model.", "completion": "To analyze the tail risk, I will configure the `QuantumMonteCarloEngine` with the following parameters: Jump Intensity (lambda) = 0.5, Jump Size Mean = -0.15, Jump Size Std = 0.10. I will run 10,000 quantum trajectories. The resulting Value-at-Risk (VaR) at the 99% confidence level indicates a potential drawdown of -22% in a 'Black Swan' event scenario."}
{"prompt": "Calculate the intrinsic value of Nvidia using the v23.5 Deep Dive protocol.", "completion": "Using the `FundamentalAnalystAgent` within the Deep Dive protocol: 1) Revenue CAGR projected at 45% for 3 years. 2) WACC assumption set to 9.2%. 3) Terminal growth rate at 4.5% (Sovereign AI premium). The DCF model yields an intrinsic value of $142.50 per share, implying the stock is currently Fairly Valued."}
{"prompt": "Explain the difference between Classical and Quantum VaR.", "completion": "Classical VaR typically assumes a normal distribution (Gaussian) for returns, often underestimating tail risks (kurtosis). Quantum VaR, specifically using the Matsakos-Nield framework, encodes the probability distribution into quantum amplitudes, allowing for efficient sampling of extreme tail events and non-linear correlations that classical Monte Carlo struggles to compute in polynomial time."}
{"prompt": "Generate a 'Greenwashing' risk assessment for an ESG-focused ETF.", "completion": "Initiating `ESGGraph` analysis. Node traversal reveals a 15% allocation to 'Clean Tech' holding companies with undisclosed subsidiary links to fossil fuel extraction. Sentiment analysis on regulatory filings flags a high frequency of vague sustainability claims. Conviction Score: Low. Recommendation: Underweight due to reputational risk contagion."}
{"prompt": "Simulate a 'Taiwan Strait Blockade' scenario impacting the Semiconductor supply chain.", "completion": "Activating `CrisisSimulationGraph`. Injecting 'Taiwan Strait Blockade' event node. Propagating shocks: 1) TSMC production halt (-100% capacity). 2) NVDA/AMD/AAPL revenue impact (-60% annualized). 3) Global GDP impact (-2.5%). The contagion vectors extend to Tier 2 auto-manufacturers and cloud hyperscalers. Risk Level: Critical."}
