The history of significant fines ($15M) and the groundwater lawsuit indicate weak internal controls and potential for substantial future liabilities (legal & remediation). 2. **Social (High):** Poor safety record (TRIR 1.2) suggests operational inefficiencies and risk of business interruption. 3. **Governance (Medium-High):** Lack of board independence and combined CEO/Chair role reduces oversight effectiveness. **Conclusion:** ESG factors present a material downside to credit quality, specifically regarding legal provisions and potential regulatory cap-ex requirements.\"}"}

Biodiversity concerns are a localized project risk, manageable through mitigation, rather than a systemic enterprise risk. 2. **Social (Low):** Stable labor relations and clean supply chain reduce operational disruption risks. 3. **Governance (Low):** Strong oversight structures (independent audit committee) protect creditor interests. **Conclusion:** Strong ESG performance supports the credit rating, likely lowering the cost of capital through Green Bond eligibility.\"}"}
