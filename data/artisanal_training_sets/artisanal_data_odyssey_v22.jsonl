At this level, the FCF conversion rate (<50%) shifts the asset from a 'Repayment Profile' to a 'Refinancing Profile,' significantly increasing terminal risk.\n\n**Adversarial Red Team:** Proponents may argue cost synergies justify the multiple. However, sensitivity analysis shows a 10% EBITDA contraction breaches covenants in Year 2.\n\n## Actionable Recommendations\n1.  **Reject** current debt quantum of $400M.\n2.  **Counter-offer** max debt of $300M (6.0x) or require 40% equity contribution.\n\n## Audit Trail\n```json\n{\"agents\": [\"Fundamental Analyst\", \"Risk Assessment\"], \"logic\": \"CreditSentry_7x_Rule\", \"provenance\": \"User_Input_EBITDA\"}\n```"}]}
