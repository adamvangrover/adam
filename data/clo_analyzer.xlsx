### Key Components of the Workbook:
1. **Input Data Sheet**: For users to input their data like tranche sizes, loan details, CDS assumptions, and market interest rates.
2. **Loan Amortization Schedule**: This will automatically calculate the loan payment schedule based on user inputs.
3. **Tranche Cash Flow Waterfall**: Automatically calculates the distribution of cash flows among the CLO tranches.
4. **CDS Pricing**: Based on the user-defined credit risk, loss given default, and other assumptions.
5. **Risk Metrics**: Calculations based on the risk profile and loan/tranche details.

### Structure

#### 1. **Input Data Sheet**

| **Input** | **Description** | **Example** |
|---|---|---|
| CLO Tranches | Define the tranches within the CLO (e.g., Senior, Mezzanine, Equity) | Senior, Mezzanine 1, Mezzanine 2, Equity |
| Tranche Size | Amount of principal for each tranche | $200 million, $100 million, $50 million, $50 million |
| Tranche Coupon | Interest rate paid on each tranche | 4.5%, 6.0%, 8.0%, 12.0% |
| Underlying Assets | Portfolio of leveraged loans backing the CLO |  |
| Loan Details | For each loan: Principal amount, Interest rate, Credit rating, Maturity date | $10 million, 8.0%, B2, 5 years |
| Default Assumptions | Probability of default for each loan | Based on credit ratings and historical data |
| Recovery Rate | Percentage of principal recovered in case of default | Based on historical recovery rates |
| Current Interest Rate | Prevailing market interest rate | 3.5% |
| **Other Assumptions** | E.g., Risk-free rate, Loss Given Default, Default Probability | Based on market data |

#### 2. **Loan Amortization Schedule**

| **Loan ID** | **Principal** | **Interest Rate** | **Maturity** | **Payment** | **Remaining Balance** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Loan 1 | $10 million | 8.0% | 5 years | Calculated | Automatically calculated |
| Loan 2 | $15 million | 7.5% | 7 years | Calculated | Automatically calculated |

In Excel, we would use **PMT** and **IPMT** functions to calculate the payment and interest amounts. For example:

```excel
=PMT(interest_rate/12, months, principal)
```

```excel
=IPMT(interest_rate/12, period, months, principal)
```

#### 3. **Tranche Cash Flow Waterfall**

| **Period** | **Senior** | **Mezzanine 1** | **Mezzanine 2** | **Equity** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Formula | Formula | Formula | Formula |
| 2 | Formula | Formula | Formula | Formula |

Here, cash flows are calculated based on the waterfall logic. For instance:

1. Start with the total loan payment (or cash inflow).
2. Apply the payments to each tranche sequentially.
3. Each tranche receives its pro-rata share based on size, until exhausted.

We use formulas that subtract the amounts from the remaining cash inflow after each tranche is paid.

#### 4. **CDS Pricing Model**

| **Asset/Tranche** | **Probability of Default** | **Loss Given Default** | **CDS Spread** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Loan 1 | 2% | 50% | Formula |
| Senior Tranche | 0.5% | 20% | Formula |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

The **CDS Spread** is calculated as:

```excel
=EL / PV(Premium Leg)
```

Where:
- **EL (Expected Loss)** = `PD * (1 - LGD) * Notional`
- **PV (Present Value of Premium Leg)** is calculated using a discount factor based on the market risk-free rate.

#### 5. **Risk Metrics Dashboard**

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|---|---|
| Weighted Average Default Probability | Formula |
| Weighted Average Recovery Rate | Formula |
| Expected Loss | Formula |
| Senior Tranche Attachment Point | Formula |
| Senior Tranche Detachment Point | Formula |

These metrics are derived based on the overall portfolio performance, weighted by the tranche sizes.

### Excel Functions and Calculations:

1. **Loan Amortization (PMT Function)**:
   For each loan, we calculate:
   ```excel
   Payment = PMT(interest_rate / 12, loan_term * 12, loan_amount)
   Interest = IPMT(interest_rate / 12, period, loan_term * 12, loan_amount)
   Principal = Payment - Interest
   Remaining Balance = Previous Balance - Principal
   ```

2. **Tranche Cash Flows (Waterfall Logic)**:
   We calculate the tranche cash flows by sequentially allocating the payments based on tranche sizes and coupon rates:
   ```excel
   Senior Payment = MIN(Tranche Size, Payment * Coupon Rate)
   Mezzanine Payment = MIN(Tranche Size, Payment * Coupon Rate)
   ```

3. **CDS Spread Calculation**:
   The CDS spread is calculated based on the default probability and recovery rates:
   ```excel
   EL = PD * (1 - LGD) * Notional
   CDS Spread = EL / PV(Premium Leg)
   ```

### Final Workbook Layout:

| **Input Data** | **Loan Amortization** | **Tranche Cash Flow Waterfall** | **CDS Pricing Model** | **Risk Metrics Dashboard** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CLO Tranches | Loan ID | Period | Asset/Tranche | Metric |
| Tranche Sizes | Principal | Payment | Senior | Default Probability |
| Loan Details | Interest Rate | Remaining Balance | Mezzanine 1 | Recovery Rate |
| CDS Assumptions | Maturity |  | Mezzanine 2 | Expected Loss |
| Current Interest Rate |  |  | Equity |  |

---

### How This Works for Users:
- **Input Data**: Users modify values like loan amounts, interest rates, tranche sizes, and CDS assumptions.
- **Automatic Calculation**: When the user changes an input (like a loan amount or default probability), Excel recalculates:
  - The loan amortization schedule.
  - The cash flows for each tranche.
  - The CDS spread for each tranche.
  - The risk metrics.
  
### Deliverables:
1. **Excel Template (CLO_Analyzer.xlsx)**: Contains all the input data, formulas for calculations, and output results.
2. **Sample Output**: The sheet will dynamically generate the amortization schedules, cash flows, CDS spreads, and other metrics.

### Deployment:
This Excel workbook can be placed in a shared repository or a cloud drive, allowing users to download, update their inputs, and instantly view the results. No need for external scripts or running Python â€“ it's entirely self-contained within Excel.
