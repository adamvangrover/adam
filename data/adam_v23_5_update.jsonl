The 'Soft Landing' applies to the aggregate average, but the underlying reality for the bottom 80% is a hard landing."}]}

Revenue is recycled, not organic.\n2.  **The Private Equity Trap:** PE-backed roll-ups (healthcare/software) bought at 15x EBITDA are seeing Debt Service Coverage Ratios (DSCR) collapse below 1.0x due to rates remaining ~3.5%+. \n3.  **The Outcome:** We predict a 'Zombie' status for 30-40% of these sectors.
